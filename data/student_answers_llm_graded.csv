### Marking Criteria Evaluation:

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate does not clearly identify an advantage of starting a business as a private limited company. The statement ""You deal and finance with the problems directly"" is vague and does not align with the specific advantages listed in the mark scheme, such as limited liability or the ability to sell shares to raise finance. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**
  - Since the candidate did not identify a clear advantage, there is no explanation provided. The statement ""You deal and finance with the problems directly"" does not explain any specific advantage of a private limited company. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

### Example Answers Comparison:
- The example answers provide clear advantages such as ""The owners would have limited liability"" and ""The business can sell shares to raise finance,"" followed by detailed explanations. The candidate's response does not provide a comparable level of clarity or detail.

### Conclusion:
- The candidate's response does not meet any of the marking criteria. It neither identifies a specific advantage nor provides an explanation.

The candidate has suggested a way through ""A smaller business means a lower reputation so that means they'll attract less foot traffic in person,"" and this is developed through ""but can possibly use a website to promote because a lot of advertisement is done digitally."" The candidate then does not further develop their answer. Let's evaluate the response against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of a way (1 mark)**:
  - The candidate identifies a way by stating, ""A smaller business means a lower reputation so that means they'll attract less foot traffic in person."" This suggests that the business might not rely on physical location due to lower foot traffic. This identification is somewhat implicit but can be credited as it aligns with the idea of using the internet to mitigate the need for a physical presence.
  - **Mark: 1**

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks)**:
  - The candidate explains the way by stating, ""but can possibly use a website to promote because a lot of advertisement is done digitally."" This explanation indicates that the business can use the internet for digital promotion, which can affect its location choice.
  - However, the explanation lacks depth. It does not fully develop the idea of how using a website for promotion can influence the business's location choice, such as choosing a cheaper location or not requiring a physical retail location.
  - **Mark: 1**

The candidate's response has identified a way and provided a basic explanation, but it lacks the depth and development needed for full marks. The response does not fully explain how the internet affects the location choice in terms of cost savings or the necessity of a physical presence.

### Mark Scheme Breakdown:
1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - Correct formula: Break-even point = Fixed Costs / (Selling Price - Variable Costs)
   - Substitution: £10,000 / (£6.50 - £2.50) = 2,500 units

2. **Calculation of decrease in break-even level of output:**

### Evaluation:
1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The answer does not show the substitution into the correct formula. No marks can be awarded for this step.

2. **Calculation of decrease in break-even level of output:**
   - The answer ""6000 units"" does not relate to the decrease in the break-even level of output. It appears to be an incorrect final answer without any working shown.

  - 2","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","With Amelia being a trained plumber, she will have the manual labour experience but not the business or the financial side so she should get financially informed and learn how to run a business.","**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer does not directly outline a specific way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success. Instead, it focuses on Amelia's need to get financially informed and learn how to run a business. This does not meet the criteria of outlining a specific financial tool or method (e.g., cash-flow forecast, break-even analysis) that could help forecast success. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The points in the answer are not linked in a way that directly addresses how financial information in a business plan could help forecast success. The response is more about Amelia's need for financial education rather than linking specific financial information to business success. Thus, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - Since the points are not linked and do not directly address the question, the answer can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark. However, even for 1 mark, the response should at least mention a relevant financial aspect, which it does not.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provided in the mark scheme clearly outline specific financial tools (e.g., cash-flow forecast, break-even forecast) and link them to how they help forecast success. The given answer does not do this.

  - The challenge of setting up a plumbing business in Birmingham, where competition is high, could be a driving force for Amelia (AO2).
  - Amelia may want to gain more independence after working for someone else for six years (AO2).
  - As a result, she would be determined to succeed as there are very few female business owners in the plumbing industry. This could give her an extra incentive to do well. (AO3a).
  - Therefore, by setting up Lili Heating Ltd she can be her own boss and make her own decisions. She no longer has to carry out repairs on houses for someone else (AO3a).

The answer identifies a non-financial aim, which is Amelia's desire to relate to female customers who may feel more comfortable with a woman performing plumbing work. However, the response does not develop this point further or provide any detailed analysis.

**Level Determination:**

- **Application of Knowledge and Understanding (AO2):** The response shows a limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context.

- **Analysis (AO3a):** The response attempts to deconstruct the business information but finds limited connections between points. There is no detailed analysis or logical chains of reasoning provided.

**Level Assignment:**
- The response fits the criteria for **Level 1** due to its limited application and lack of detailed analysis.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The marketing mix typically includes the 4 Ps: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. The answer ""female leadership"" does not directly correspond to any of these elements. 
   - The example answers provided in the mark scheme are:
     - ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham"" (Place)
     - ""Promotion methods to attract female customers"" (Promotion)
     - ""Product is to repair/install boilers"" (Product)
   - ""Female leadership"" does not fit into any of these categories. It is more related to the unique selling point or the business's internal characteristics rather than an element of the marketing mix.

### Conclusion

- The answer ""female leadership"" does not satisfy the criteria of stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.
- There is no evidence of application to the marketing mix elements (Product, Place, Promotion, or Price) as required by the mark scheme.

### Marks Awarded

- **0 marks**: The answer does not meet the criteria of stating an element of the marketing mix.

### Final Remarks

- The answer should have referred to one of the elements of the marketing mix (Product, Place, Promotion, or Price) and applied it to Lili Heating Ltd. For example, mentioning the ""promotion methods to attract female customers"" would have been appropriate and aligned with the context provided.

  example_answer: 
    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.",Promote with social media. Just because the company is ran by women doesn't mean you can discount women. Men deserve equality too.,"The candidate's response is very brief and lacks depth. 

- **Application of Knowledge and Understanding (AO2):** The response shows a very limited application of business concepts to the context of Lili Heating Ltd. The mention of social media is relevant but not developed. The comment about equality is not directly relevant to the business decision at hand.
- **Deconstruction of Business Information and Issues (AO3a):** There is no deconstruction of business information or issues. The response does not provide interconnected points or chains of reasoning.
- **Judgement and Justification (AO3b):** The response makes a simple judgement without any substantial justification or evaluation of business information and issues.

Overall, the response demonstrates a limited understanding of the business scenario and lacks the necessary analysis and evaluation to progress beyond Level 1.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

#### Criteria: Stating one risk for investors in Ripple

- **Evaluation**: The answer ""no guarantee"" is vague and does not explicitly state a specific risk. The marking scheme examples provide clear and specific risks such as ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" or ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy."" The answer does not provide a specific risk that can be directly linked to the context of Ripple.

### Contextual Evaluation

- **Context**: Ripple is an energy company providing green and renewable energy through a consumer-owned wind farm. Investors buy a part of the wind farm and are supplied with energy based on their investment. The context mentions potential risks such as the business failing due to lack of demand or investors not receiving enough energy.

- **Evaluation**: The answer ""no guarantee"" could imply a general risk, but it does not directly relate to the specific risks mentioned in the context, such as financial loss or insufficient energy supply. It lacks the specificity required to meet the marking criteria.

### Conclusion

- The answer does not successfully state a specific risk for investors in Ripple.
- It does not fulfill the criteria of providing a clear and specific risk as required by the mark scheme.
- The answer is too vague and does not provide evidence of application to the context of Ripple.

Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria and the context provided.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation:

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer ""direct solution planning"" does not clearly outline a specific benefit to customers. It is vague and does not directly address how customers benefit from Ripple asking questions to identify their needs. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Example Answers:**
  - The example answers provided in the mark scheme include specific benefits such as ""Customers will receive the correct green energy plan"" and ""This will make sure they receive the correct amount of energy for their needs."" The given answer does not align with these examples as it lacks specificity and does not clearly link to a benefit for the customers.

- **Linked Development and Evidence of Application:**
  - The answer does not provide linked development or evidence of application. It does not explain how ""direct solution planning"" benefits the customers of Ripple. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

### Context Evaluation:

- **Contextual Relevance:**
  - The context mentions that Ripple asks customers questions to identify their energy needs and then creates a green energy plan. The answer ""direct solution planning"" does not make a clear connection to this process or explain how it benefits the customers. Therefore, the answer lacks contextual relevance.

### Conclusion:

The answer ""direct solution planning"" does not meet the criteria outlined in the mark scheme. It is too vague and does not provide a clear benefit to customers, nor does it include linked development or evidence of application.

### Marks Awarded:

- **0 marks**: The answer does not fulfill any of the marking criteria.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But

To improve, the student should include more specific factual knowledge and evaluate the provenance of the sources. For example, they could discuss the significance of Source B being published in a British newspaper in 1917 and how it might reflect public morale or propaganda. For Source C, they could mention the author's firsthand experience and the reliability of his account.

They mention the pressure from France, Britain, and Russia on Germany, which is relevant but lacks detailed factual knowledge and developed reasoning. The explanation is simple and does not fully explore the complexities of the Alliance System.

The student also mentions the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand as another cause of the war, but this explanation is brief and lacks specific details about the event and its consequences. The mention of the German government being behind the assassination is incorrect and shows a misunderstanding of the historical context.

The explanation of the Alliance System in the second paragraph is more detailed, mentioning the Triple Entente and the alliances with Belgium. However, the reasoning remains simple and does not fully develop the impact of these alliances on the outbreak of the war.

The conclusion reiterates the student's agreement with the statement but does not provide a complex or sustained judgement. The overall structure is coherent, but the explanations lack depth and detailed factual knowledge.

Overall, the answer falls into Level 2. The student provides a simple explanation of the stated factor and another factor, but the reasoning is not developed, and the knowledge is not detailed.

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors:
     - ""goverment"" should be ""government.""
     - ""Britains'"" should be ""Britain's.""
   - Punctuation is generally accurate, but there are minor issues:
     - The comma after ""built"" in the first sentence is unnecessary.
     - The sentence ""they Britain and France both promised to attack if Germany tried to invade Belgium and try to keep them out."" is awkwardly punctuated and structured.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are some issues:
     - The phrase ""built made tensions high"" is grammatically incorrect and should be rephrased.
     - The sentence ""this also built tension as many people thought it was the German goverment behind it."" could be clearer.
     - The sentence ""they Britain and France both promised to attack if Germany tried to invade Belgium and try to keep them out."" is grammatically awkward and should be rephrased for clarity.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses several specialist terms appropriately, such as ""Triple Entente,"" ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand,"" and ""allies.""

Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme:

- **Level 1:** The student does not meet the criteria for consistent accuracy in spelling and punctuation, nor do they demonstrate effective control of grammar throughout.
- **Level 2:** The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy, and they use grammar with general control of meaning overall. They also use a good range of specialist terms.
- **Level 3:** The student exceeds the threshold performance level, as their errors do not significantly hinder meaning, and they use a limited range of specialist terms.

Considering the forgiving nature of the grading and the overall performance, the student’s answer fits best in **Level 2**. The errors present are not severe enough to drop the answer to Level 3, and the use of specialist terms is more than limited.

This represents the allies frustration against russia and especially the bolsheviks as they left the war and had signed a peace treaty with Germany giving up significant portions of valueable land.
","The student identifies relevant features of the source, such as the Bolsheviks 'backstabbing the allies' and the presence of Kaiser Wilhelm II. They also provide some contextual knowledge about the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the peace treaty with Germany. However, the analysis is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. The student does not fully explain how these features are critical of the Bolsheviks, nor do they provide detailed factual knowledge to support their points. 

To reach Level 2, the student would need to develop their analysis further, explaining how the Bolsheviks' actions were seen as a betrayal by the Allies and providing more detailed factual knowledge about the consequences of the peace treaty with Germany.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In source B, we can see an image displaying the tradectory of artillery bombardments. The allies use the cover created by the smoke and explosions to advance through no-mans land with the element of surprise. This allowed it so that the enemy would have a difficult time discerning where the enemy were attacking from. This form of tactical manouvering is known as a 'creeping barrage'. The allies would time artillery bombardment at certain angles and simultaneously the soldiers would 'creep in'.

Tanks were first introduced in the battle of the Somme 1916, but were largely inneffective as they were slow (only reaching speeds of 4 mph), many tactics were

not developed for them as the British thought of not much use for them. But by 1917 and 1918, tanks were being deployed in large rows of 200-300 tanks which would cross over no-mans land and destroy the barbed wire defences. In source C, we see the mention of machine guns on the tanks as they were added as a way to bring more firepower. These machine guns were mounted on and could turn 360 degrees to inflict damage upon the enemies.","The student begins by describing the content of Source B, explaining the use of artillery bombardments and the tactic of the 'creeping barrage'. This shows a basic understanding of the source and its relevance to military tactics in the First World War. The student also provides some contextual knowledge about the use of artillery and the element of surprise, which is a good start towards evaluation.

In the second paragraph, the student discusses the development and use of tanks, referencing Source C. They provide some historical context about the introduction of tanks in the Battle of the Somme and their initial ineffectiveness. The student then links this to the content of Source C, mentioning the 'Whippets' tanks and their machine guns, which were used to scatter German soldiers.

However, the evaluation of the sources is not fully developed. The student does not explicitly address the provenance of the sources or how this affects their utility. For example, they could discuss the significance of Source B being published in a British newspaper in 1917 and how this might influence its portrayal of military tactics. Similarly, they could evaluate the reliability of Source C, considering it is an account from a tank commander published after the war.

To reach a higher level, the student needs to provide more detailed evaluation of both the content and provenance of the sources. They should also make more explicit links to the utility of the sources for a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.

Overall, this answer falls into Level 2 due to the simple evaluation of the content and some contextual knowledge. To achieve Level 3, the student would need to provide extended reasoning related to utility and evaluate the provenance of the sources more thoroughly.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan was heavily reliant on Russia taking a long time to mobilize and a very quick and decisive win against France (in 40 days). The plan was to have a large bulk of the German army invade France by cutting into Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg to surprise the French, who would be anticipating an attack directly into France on the boarder between them. However, the Schlieffen plan failed as Russia only took 10 days to mobilize (faster than expected) and Belgium put up a fierce and resistance fight against the Germans (much more resistance than Germany had anticipated). Ultimately, invading through Belgium only helped the stalemate last longer as Britain was forced to join the war effort as invading Belgium initiated an 1843 treaty of London where Britain vowed to protect Belgium. This prolonged the war significantly, turning 40 days into 4 years.
","The student provides a structured account of the Schlieffen Plan and its failure, demonstrating specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The answer identifies key elements of the plan, such as the reliance on Russia's slow mobilization and the quick defeat of France, and explains how these expectations were not met. The student also highlights the unexpected resistance from Belgium and the subsequent involvement of Britain due to the 1843 Treaty of London.

The analysis of causation and consequence is clear, particularly in explaining how the failure of the Schlieffen Plan led to a prolonged war. However, the answer could be further developed by providing more detailed factual knowledge and a more complex analysis of how these events led to a stalemate and trench warfare on the Western Front.

Overall, the answer falls into Level 3 due to its structured and well-ordered narrative, accurate knowledge, and developed analysis of causation and consequence.

The alliances were the main trigger for many of the events, wars and crises that led up to world war one. The black hand (a terrorist group) assasinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the heir to the austrian-hungarian throne) leaving only serbia to blame for the assasination. Austria-Hungary sent a couple requests to the Serbian government but the government accepted all except one (which allowed Austria-Hungary full control over the Serbian police force). Austria-Hungary soon declared war on Serbia which prompted Russia to declare war on Austria-Hungary in defence of Serbia, Germany to declare war on Russia, France to declare war on Germany. Then Germany invaded Belgium bringing Britain into the war as it triggered the 1843 treaty of London which Britain vowed to protect Belgium from invading forces. Because of Archduke Franz Ferdinand's death,Europe was involved in an all-out war.

In 1871, shortly after Germany's unification, Germany and Austria-Hungary made an alliance together as they both shared similar cuteral identities,had shared the same common language of German and were politically close to each other. Later, the Italians joined the dual alliance to form the triple alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. In 1892, France and Russia formed an alliance together. This was a threat towards Germany as it meant they could be attacked from either the East or the West. Later in 1904, Britain formed an alliance with France, known as the Entente Cordiale (Friendly alliance). Then in 1906, Britain, France and Russia all came together to form the triple Entente. The alliance system made political disputes more intense as one disagreement could lead to a major war. This is clearly seen in the Moroccan crisises and the Balkan wars. The involvement of this many countries made it impossible to avoid an all  out war from breaking out in Europe, thus causing the start of World War One.","The student begins by addressing the given factor, the Alliance System, and explains how it divided Europe into two camps. They provide a detailed account of the events following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, showing how the alliances led to a chain reaction of war declarations. This demonstrates a good understanding of the immediate causes of World War I and the role of the alliances in escalating the conflict. This part of the answer shows a range of accurate knowledge and understanding, placing it in Level 3.

In the second paragraph, the student provides a historical context for the alliances, explaining the formation of the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente. They discuss the cultural and political reasons behind these alliances and how they created a tense environment in Europe. The explanation of the alliances' impact on political disputes, such as the Moroccan crises and the Balkan wars, further supports their argument. This paragraph also demonstrates a developed, sustained line of reasoning with coherence and logical structure, which is characteristic of Level 3.

However, the answer lacks a complex explanation of other factors that contributed to the outbreak of World War I, such as militarism, imperialism, and nationalism.

### Analysis:

1. **Spelling:**
   - The student has a few spelling errors: ""assasinated"" should be ""assassinated,"" ""austrian-hungarian"" should be ""Austro-Hungarian,"" ""cuteral"" should be ""cultural,"" and ""crisises"" should be ""crises.""
   - Despite these errors, the majority of the words are spelled correctly.

2. **Punctuation:**
   - The student uses punctuation reasonably well, but there are some issues:
     - Missing commas in compound sentences (e.g., ""The black hand (a terrorist group) assasinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the heir to the austrian-hungarian throne) leaving only serbia to blame for the assasination."" should have a comma after ""throne"").
     - Inconsistent capitalization (e.g., ""serbia"" should be ""Serbia"").
     - Missing spaces after commas (e.g., ""identities,had"" should be ""identities, had"").
     - Some sentences are long and could benefit from being broken up for clarity.

3. **Grammar:**
   - The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are some issues:
     - Some sentences are run-on and could be clearer with better structure (e.g., ""Austria-Hungary sent a couple requests to the Serbian government but the government accepted all except one (which allowed Austria-Hungary full control over the Serbian police force)."").
     - The use of tenses is mostly consistent, but there are minor issues with subject-verb agreement and sentence structure.

4. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately (e.g., ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand,"" ""Austro-Hungarian,"" ""Entente Cordiale,"" ""triple alliance,"" ""triple Entente,"" ""Moroccan crises,"" ""Balkan wars"").

### Conclusion:
- The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy, though there are some errors.
- The student uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, and the errors do not significantly hinder meaning overall.
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately.

Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer fits best within **Level 2**. The errors present are not severe enough to drop the answer to Level 3, and the use of specialist terms and overall control of meaning is strong enough to warrant a higher mark within Level 2.

German kaiser. It looks as if the Kaiser wants the bolsheviks

Set in the first word war. (During WW1). The lady
which is labeled russia seems like she cannot do
anything about the bolskveiks trying to steal the gold. They
have put 'BETRAYED' this is because Bosnia had asked
russia for help whilst having war threats. So they 
asked russia for help and it shows now that they are stealing
money for the germans in WWI and they are taking it from the russians. ","The student identifies relevant features of the source, such as the German Kaiser and the figure labeled ""Russia,"" and attempts to explain the meaning behind the cartoon. However, the explanation is somewhat confused and lacks clarity. The student does not provide accurate contextual knowledge or a clear analysis of why the source is critical of the Bolsheviks. The mention of ""Bosnia"" and ""stealing gold"" is incorrect and irrelevant to the context of the Bolshevik Revolution and Russia's withdrawal from World War I.

To improve, the student should focus on the key elements of the source and provide accurate historical context. For example, they could explain that the cartoon is critical of the Bolsheviks because it shows them dragging Russia towards Germany, symbolizing the betrayal of the Allies by making peace with Germany in 1918. This allowed Germany to concentrate its forces on the Western Front, which was detrimental to the Allied war effort.

Overall, this answer falls into level 1 and should be awarded 1 mark.

**Marking Criteria:**

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate states, ""One advantage of starting a business as a private limited company is that the business will have money."" This is not a clear identification of an advantage specific to a private limited company. The mark scheme expects advantages like limited liability or the ability to sell shares to raise finance. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**
  - The candidate continues with ""and will not be able to struggle and may already have customers."" This explanation is vague and does not clearly link to the specific advantages of a private limited company. The mark scheme expects explanations such as limited liability protecting personal assets or raising finance through selling shares. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In source B it shows the British Soilders advancing under an artillery barrage. The british Soilder were running in waves all in different waves. this is because they cannot be in any artillery barage. you can see that all the soilders are running and still alive and not getting under an artillery barage. Each wave protects you from a plane and from bombs dropping on you.

In Source C it Shows that the german Soilder were preparing an attack on the british tank, but then 7 of the newest and fastest tanks named whippets came and drove straight into the german Soilders and scattered them in all directions, which this had destroyed the German threat. This helps the students studying military technology understand about how fast and powerful the Whippet was. In source B shows how useful and how good the strategy was used by the british soldiers were they could run across the battlefield without dying this helps the student studying Military technology.

","The student provides a basic analysis of both sources, identifying relevant features and explaining their significance. For Source B, the student notes that British soldiers are advancing under an artillery barrage and explains the tactic of running in waves to avoid being hit by artillery. For Source C, the student describes how the Whippet tanks scattered German soldiers and eliminated the threat, highlighting the effectiveness of the new tank technology.

However, the analysis lacks depth and detailed contextual knowledge. The student does not provide extended reasoning or evaluate the provenance of the sources. There is also a lack of specific historical context, such as the significance of the German Spring Offensive or the development of tank warfare during the First World War.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to include more detailed factual knowledge, evaluate the provenance of the sources, and provide extended reasoning related to the utility of the sources for studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.

1. **Substitution into correct formula**:

   - The given Answer does not show this correct substitution. Instead, it shows:
     \[
     £10,000 / 250 = 400
     \]

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output**:
   - The correct calculation should be:
     \[
     \text{Decrease} = 4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}

The candidate has suggested an advantage through 'this could make people want to work for a business'. However, the explanation is somewhat fragmented and lacks clarity. Let's break down the response according to the marking criteria:

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate identifies an advantage by stating, ""this could make people want to work for a business."" This aligns with the example answer, ""Employees will feel that the business is taking good care of them,"" which is an acceptable identification of an advantage. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. (1 mark)

- **Explanation of the advantage:**
  - The candidate attempts to explain the advantage by mentioning ""by following a legal obligation like employee's wage or discrimination. or even paying them on time."" However, the explanation is not fully developed and lacks coherence. The candidate does not clearly link how meeting legal obligations leads to the advantage of attracting employees. The explanation does not reach the level of detail seen in the example answers, such as ""This means the business would not have to face financial consequences such as a fine"" or ""Therefore, the business will have a more motivated workforce."" Therefore, this criterion is not fully satisfied. (0 marks)

Overall, the candidate identifies an advantage but does not provide a clear and coherent explanation. Thus, the answer should be awarded 1 mark.

Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The points in the answer are not clearly linked.

This is because a factor which led to World War 1 was the Morrocan crisis which this had France wanted to take over Morroco and Germany's kaiser went to Tangier to show support on Morrocos full independence. This was to see how far France would push. And Britain was allies with France so if Germany would war with France britian would be there for support.

Another factor was when there was a rebillion in tukey and they used this as an opportunity to take advantage of Turkey's weakened state.","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's assess the student's answer for Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG).

### Analysis:

1. **Spelling:**
   - ""Morrocan"" should be ""Moroccan.""
   - ""Morroco"" should be ""Morocco.""
   - ""britian"" should be ""Britain.""
   - ""rebillion"" should be ""rebellion.""
   - ""tukey"" should be ""Turkey.""

2. **Punctuation:**
   - The sentence ""This is because a factor which led to World War 1 was the Morrocan crisis which this had France wanted to take over Morroco and Germany's kaiser went to Tangier to show support on Morrocos full independence."" is a run-on sentence and needs to be broken down for clarity.
   - ""This was to see how far France would push."" could be better connected to the previous sentence for coherence.
   - ""And Britain was allies with France so if Germany would war with France britian would be there for support."" should be rephrased for clarity and punctuation: ""Britain was allied with France, so if Germany went to war with France, Britain would support them.""
   - ""Another factor was when there was a rebillion in tukey and they used this as an opportunity to take advantage of Turkey's weakened state."" should be rephrased for clarity: ""Another factor was the rebellion in Turkey, which was used as an opportunity to take advantage of Turkey's weakened state.""

3. **Grammar:**
   - The sentence structure is often awkward and unclear, affecting the overall meaning.
   - The use of ""this had France wanted to take over Morroco"" is grammatically incorrect and confusing.
   - ""Germany's kaiser went to Tangier to show support on Morrocos full independence"" should be ""Germany's Kaiser went to Tangier to show support for Morocco's full independence.""
   - ""if Germany would war with France britian would be there for support"" should be ""if Germany went to war with France, Britain would support them.""

4. **Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses some specialist terms such as ""Moroccan crisis,"" ""Kaiser,"" and ""rebellion,"" but the range is limited and not always used accurately.

### Conclusion:
The student's answer demonstrates reasonable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, but there are several errors that affect clarity. The grammar shows some control of meaning, but the errors do hinder understanding to some extent. The use of specialist terms is limited and not always accurate.

Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme, the student's performance aligns most closely with **Level 3**:

- **Spelling and punctuation with reasonable accuracy**: There are several spelling errors, but they do not severely hinder understanding.
- **Grammar with some control of meaning**: The meaning is generally understandable, though some errors affect clarity.
- **Limited range of specialist terms**: The student uses some specialist terms, but the range is limited.

### Marking Criteria:
1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The Answer provided is: ""What work needs to be done and how it needs to be done to a high standard.""
   - The marketing mix consists of the 4 Ps: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. The question specifically asks for an element other than price.
   - The Answer seems to be referring to the quality of the service provided, which can be interpreted as part of the ""Product"" element of the marketing mix. The Mark Scheme example ""Product is to repair/install boilers"" supports this interpretation.
   - Therefore, the Answer does satisfy this criterion as it indirectly refers to the ""Product"" element by emphasizing the quality of the work.

### Marking Notes:
- **To award 1 mark there must be evidence of application.**
  - The Answer does not explicitly mention ""Product"" but implies it by discussing the quality of the work, which is a key aspect of the product in a service-based business like plumbing.
  - The context supports this interpretation as it mentions that Amelia's target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and emphasizes the high standard of work, which aligns with the Answer provided.

### Conclusion:
- The Answer successfully addresses the criterion by referring to the ""Product"" element of the marketing mix, albeit indirectly.
- The context supports this interpretation, making the Answer relevant and applicable.

### Marks Awarded:
- **1 mark** for correctly identifying an element of the marketing mix (Product) and providing evidence of application.

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer does not provide linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. The response states, ""Because many female customers feel that they can relate more easily with doing repairs in their house,"" which is more about customer preference rather than a reason for government interest. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The points in the answer are not linked to the government's interest. The response does not mention any government-related benefits such as tax collection or employment. Hence, it does not meet the criteria for linked points and can only be considered for a maximum of 1 mark.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provide clear reasons why the government would want the business to be successful, such as tax collection or employment opportunities. The given answer does not align with these examples as it focuses on customer preferences rather than government benefits.

**Marking Notes:**
- The marking notes specify that to award 2 marks, there must be linked development and evidence of application. The given answer lacks both linked development and application to the government's perspective.

**Total Marks:**
- The total marks for this question are 2. However, since the answer does not provide linked points or relevant context to the government's interest, it does not meet the criteria for full marks.

  example_answer: 
    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.",I think Lili heating LTD should consider option 1 which is offer a discounted price to female customers. This is because if a woman gets a discount this could be forwarded to other women which is another way of promoting a business by people sharing it and telling friends and family. This could help towards promoting a business. Overall this will lead to an increase in profit and having an increase in profit for Lili heating LTD is good as she has just started and will not need to struggle of survival. And option 2 that doesn't help as much as option 1 towards business growth.,"The candidate begins by stating that Lili Heating Ltd should consider Option 1, which is to offer a discounted price to female customers. This is followed by a justification that focuses on the potential for word-of-mouth promotion, which is a valid point and demonstrates some understanding of business concepts (AO2). However, the application of knowledge is somewhat limited and lacks depth, as it does not fully explore the implications or potential drawbacks of this option.

The analysis (AO3a) is basic and lacks interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning. The candidate mentions that word-of-mouth promotion could lead to increased profit, but does not provide a detailed explanation or consider other factors that might influence this outcome. The analysis is therefore limited and does not meet the criteria for higher levels.

The evaluation (AO3b) is present but simplistic. The candidate concludes that Option 1 is better for business growth compared to Option 2, but this judgement is based on a limited evaluation of the information provided. The conclusion lacks depth and does not thoroughly consider the potential risks or benefits of each option.

Overall, the answer demonstrates limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts, with basic analysis and a simple judgement. This places the answer in Level 1.

  - 1","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",This can make one person own a share in a lot depending on how much. So a person can own more of a share.

### Marking Criteria: 
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer states, ""And they can lose out on more and can go bankrupt as they are a small business.""
   - This statement identifies a potential risk for investors, which is the possibility of losing their investment and going bankrupt. This aligns with the marking criteria of stating a risk for investors.
   - The context supports this risk as it mentions that customers invest money into the wind farm, and there is an inherent risk in any investment, especially in a small business.

### Conclusion:
The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple, which is the potential loss of investment and bankruptcy. This satisfies the marking criteria.

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer does mention a benefit to customers by stating, ""This will create a green energy plan to establish how much a customer should invest into Ripple."" This aligns with the marking criteria as it identifies a benefit to customers. However, the benefit is not clearly articulated in terms of how it directly benefits the customer, such as ensuring they receive the correct amount of energy for their needs or getting the best return on their investment. Therefore, this part of the answer is somewhat vague and does not fully satisfy the criteria.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer attempts to provide linked development by stating, ""This will be favorited by people. People will recommend this business and people will use their services. This will lead into an increase in profit, as they are a small business."" However, this development is more focused on the benefits to Ripple rather than the customers. The marking scheme requires the benefit to be clearly linked to the customers, such as receiving the correct energy plan or investment return. The answer does not provide sufficient evidence of application to the customers' perspective.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - Since the points are not effectively linked to the customers' benefit and the development is more focused on Ripple's profit rather than the customers' advantage, the answer can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",this will help the business from not being able to struggle if the price is right ig its a good price people will recommend it to other people and this will help the business growth by telling family and friends can help to lead into an increase in profit.,"The candidate's response is very limited and lacks depth. The answer does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix. The response is vague and does not provide any specific details or examples related to Ripple's business context. 

- **Knowledge and Understanding (AO1b):** The response does not demonstrate elements of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues. There is no use of business terminology, and the explanation is very basic and unclear.
- **Application (AO2):** There is no application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context. The response does not mention Ripple or any specific details about the company or its pricing strategy.
- **Analysis (AO3a):** The response does not attempt to deconstruct business information and/or issues. There are no connections between points, and the reasoning is very limited.
- **Evaluation (AO3b):** The response does not draw a conclusion or provide any justification based on the evaluation of business information and issues. The statements made are generic and unsupported.

Overall, the response does not meet the criteria for Level 1. There is no rewardable material, and therefore, zero marks are awarded.

#### Identification of an Advantage
- **Criteria:** Identification of an advantage.
- **Response:** The candidate identifies an advantage by stating, ""the business won't have to worry as the business still have the sufficient funds to cover their total costs.""
- **Evaluation:** This is a valid point, as it implies financial stability, which is an advantage. The candidate successfully identifies an advantage.
- **Mark Awarded:** 1 mark.

#### Explaining the Advantage
- **Criteria:** Explaining the advantage.
- **Response:** The candidate attempts to explain the advantage by stating, ""This leads to the business not making a loss and they keep doing what they usually do. As a result of this, the business would not fail.""
- **Evaluation:** The explanation is somewhat vague and lacks depth. It does not clearly link to the specific advantages listed in the mark scheme, such as not paying interest, not increasing costs, or not diluting ownership. The explanation is more about general financial stability rather than a specific advantage of retained profit.

Therefore, this point is not fully developed and does not meet the criteria for a linked point. **(0 marks)**

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The answer attempts to link the idea of forecasting success with identifying market gaps, ""This leads to the business acknowledging the gaps in the market and potentially make the business more successful.""

The mark scheme requires a clear link between financial information and its role in forecasting success, such as ensuring enough cash flow or setting profit targets. **(0 marks)**

### Marking Criteria:
1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The correct formula should be: 
     \[
     \text{Closing balance} = \text{Opening balance} + (\text{Cash inflows} - \text{Cash outflows})
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Closing balance} = £4,000 + (£8,600 - £11,000)

2. **Correct Answer:**
   - The correct answer should be:
     \[
     \text{Closing balance} = £4,000 + (-£2,400) = £1,600
     \]

### Evaluation of the Given Answer:
- The given answer states:
  \[
  \text{Closing balance} = \text{Cash outflows} - \text{Cash inflows}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Closing balance} = £11,000 - £8,600 = £2,400
  \]
  \[
  £2,400
  \]

- The formula used in the given answer is incorrect. The correct formula involves the opening balance and the net cash flow (cash inflows minus cash outflows).

### Mark Allocation:
1. **Substitution into correct formula (1 mark):**
   - The given answer does not use the correct formula. Therefore, no mark is awarded for this criterion.

2. **Correct Answer (1 mark):**
   - The final answer provided (£2,400) is incorrect. Therefore, no mark is awarded for this criterion.

### Final Mark:
- The given answer does not meet any of the marking criteria. Therefore, the final mark is **0 out of 2**.

The second impact is that outdated research would lead to the business not fulfilling current customer needs, resulting in customers going to competitors and the business failing.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer states, ""One element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd is Quality.""
   - According to the mark scheme, acceptable elements of the marketing mix include place, promotion, and product. ""Quality"" is not explicitly listed as an element of the marketing mix in the mark scheme.
   - The example answers provided in the mark scheme are:
     - ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham"" (1)
     - ""Promotion methods to attract female customers"" (1)
     - ""Product is to repair/install boilers"" (1)
   - ""Quality"" could be considered a characteristic of the product but is not directly one of the four Ps (Product, Price, Place, Promotion) of the marketing mix.

### Application of Context

- The context mentions that Amelia aims to provide high-quality work to encourage customer recommendations, which indirectly relates to the quality of the service (product). However, the answer should explicitly mention ""product"" to align with the marking criteria.

### Conclusion

- The answer does not explicitly state one of the elements of the marketing mix as defined in the mark scheme (Product, Place, Promotion).
- Therefore, the answer does not fulfill the criteria for awarding a mark.

### Final Mark

Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd.

Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.

This will lead to many female customers feeling comfortable for a woman repairing in their homes.,"**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer states, ""she's a woman providing services to other people,"" which is a valid point but lacks a direct link to why the government would want the business to be successful. The response does not explicitly mention any government interest such as tax collection or employment, which are key reasons outlined in the mark scheme. Therefore, this criterion is not fully satisfied.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The answer does not provide linked points that directly outline a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. The response mentions that ""many female customers feeling comfortable for a woman repairing in their homes,"" but this is more about customer preference rather than a government interest. Hence, the response is not linked to the government's perspective and should be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.

Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","In order to make the business more successful, the business should use social media to promote the business. This leads to more people acknowledging the business and use their service. And as a result of this, more sales would be made within the services they provide.

Another reason is that offering a discounted price to female customers would lead to less money being made because of the discount. This would lead to a loss of revenue and as a result of this, the business would need to find gaps in the market to receive more money.

Another reason of using social media to promote the business is that it doesn't cost any money. This leads to the business attracting more customers without spending any money. And as a result of this, more sales would be made.","The candidate begins by stating that the business should use social media to promote itself. This is a clear judgement and is developed with some reasoning, indicating an understanding of the business context (AO2). The candidate mentions that social media promotion leads to increased awareness and sales, which is a valid point. However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed interconnected points, which limits the analysis (AO3a).

The candidate then discusses the disadvantages of offering discounted prices to female customers, suggesting it would lead to a loss of revenue. This shows an attempt at evaluation (AO3b), but the reasoning is somewhat simplistic and lacks thorough evaluation of the business information and issues.

The final point reiterates the benefits of using social media, emphasizing that it is cost-effective. While this is a valid point, it is repetitive and does not add new insights or detailed analysis.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a sound understanding of the business scenario with some inconsistencies. The points made are interconnected but lack detailed chains of reasoning. The judgement is justified but based on limited evaluation.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy.

This would lead to small businesses giving less tax and use the money to cover total cost, staffs, wages/salary, or use the money to improve the products or services they aid. This would lead to small businesses attracting more customers into the business and as a result of this, the small businesses wouldn’t fail or get bankrupt.

Another reason is that providing free training if small businesses recruit new employees wouldn’t help massively as Option 1 helps them save more money than Option 2. This would lead to more risks in the business failing as they might not have enough money to cover total cost. As a result of this, the business may fail.

Another reason is that the money the small businesses have left over, they could use that money to help charities or people in need. This would lead to a decreased amount of homeless and poor people.

This demonstrates some application of business concepts (AO2), but the context of Ripple is not clearly addressed. The candidate then argues that free training for new employees would not be as beneficial as tax reduction, as it would not save as much money, potentially leading to business failure.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",,No Answer is provided.

This allegorically links to the Bolsheviks switching to the Germans side.","The student identifies relevant features of the source, such as the Bolsheviks being represented as a person fighting for gold and having Germany on their side. They explain the meaning of these features, suggesting that the British publisher wanted to paint the Bolsheviks as traitors taking a bribe. However, the analysis lacks depth and does not include extended reasoning supported by factual knowledge and understanding. There is no mention of the historical context, such as the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 or the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918, which would provide a more developed analysis.

To reach Level 2, the student would need to include more detailed factual knowledge and understanding related to the features of the source. For example, they could mention that the cartoon was published in December 1917, shortly after the Bolshevik Revolution, and that Lenin made peace with Germany in 1918, which allowed Germany to concentrate its forces on the Western Front.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B is useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War as, in the source there is a tactic being implemented in which shells were fired and due to this smoke and dust rises up which creates a barrier for soldiers to follow behind, this process would then be repeated hour by hour increasing the distance by each shot this also led to enemies being pushed back, and this process was repeated until eventually the enemy trench was reached and soldiers could dive in. This process was called artillery barrage, additionally Source B would also be useful to a historian due to the fact that the source was made by a British newspaper this hints to the fact that the newspaper is going to want to present the tactic as being flawless. On the other hand Source C is useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the first World War because, the Source is talking about tanks and their new versions, this is useful as it is showing how the British went from tanks that were sent out in ones which led to them being easily picked out and broken by tanks being upgraded and being sent out in groups of 7's, 10, 20's etc, due to the tanks being sent out in groups this led to mass destruction and caused the German soldiers to be scared, it also nullified things such as barbed wire as the tanks could just go over them and flatten them causing the soldiers to be able to easily pass through without being cut, the tanks also provided cover, due to their size and speed multiple soldiers could follow from behind, and the tanks were also upgraded from just having a big cannon that took a long time to turn to having machine guns at the top that could turn a whole 360°, this is useful as it shows the evolution in weapons.","The student demonstrates a clear understanding of both sources and provides a detailed analysis of their content. For Source B, the student explains the tactic of artillery barrage and how it was used to create a barrier for soldiers, pushing back the enemy until the trench was reached. The student also evaluates the provenance by noting that the source was published by a British newspaper, which might present the tactic as flawless. This shows an understanding of potential bias, which is a key aspect of evaluating the usefulness of a source.

For Source C, the student describes the evolution of tank technology and tactics, explaining how newer tanks like the 'Whippets' were faster, more numerous, and equipped with machine guns, which made them more effective in battle. The student also notes the impact of these tanks on the battlefield, such as their ability to flatten barbed wire and provide cover for soldiers. This detailed analysis of the content, combined with the understanding of the source's provenance (a first-hand account by a tank commander), makes the evaluation comprehensive.

However, the student could improve by explicitly linking the content and provenance to the utility for historians more consistently. For example, they could state more clearly how the first-hand account in Source C provides a reliable perspective on the effectiveness of tanks, or how the British newspaper's portrayal in Source B might influence public perception of military tactics.

Overall, the answer demonstrates developed evaluation of both sources based on content and provenance, with extended reasoning related to utility.

  example_answer: []",,"the Schlieffen plan led to problems in 1914 as this is when the German's thought they could quickly invade France, however they weren't able to, this is due to different factors an example being the Franco-Prussian alliance, the alliance between France and Russia, although the Germans knew of this alliance they didn't think Russia was prepared for war, however due to the Russians having to back out of multiple wars such as when Austria-Hungary wanted to invade Bosnia, they had been rigorously preparing for any sort of conflict, another factor was the fact that France also had an alliance with Britain, the Entente Cordiale, this led to when Russia was going on their way to invade France, the British sending soldiers to assist France. This led to the German's having to send a big part of their soldier's to deal with The British, furthermore, another factor was the fact that the Germans were running out of resources. Although Germany did invade a large portion of France they still hadn't invaded it whole, this eventually led to them having to dig out trenches and for the British, French, and Russians to have to fight to win back the territory lost, the German trenches were also significantly better than the British and French due to the fact they had already won the land. This eventually led to a stalemate between both sides.","The student provides a structured account of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, moving beyond basic statements to show a simple analysis of causation and consequence. The answer identifies several factors that led to the failure of the Schlieffen Plan, such as the Franco-Prussian alliance, the Entente Cordiale, and the unexpected preparedness of Russia. The student also mentions the involvement of British troops and the eventual need for trench warfare, which led to a stalemate.

However, the answer lacks specific factual details and accurate knowledge that would elevate it to a higher level. For example, the student does not provide specific dates, names of battles, or detailed descriptions of the events. The explanation of how these factors led to problems in 1914 is somewhat general and could be more developed.

Another example is the fact that the British only got involved due to the fact that Russia invaded Belgium and England had an alliance with Belgium, which caused England to come out of their isolationaism. Furthermore another example of this is the fact that Russia only joined the war due to past tension in which Germany supported Austria-Hungary and also because they had an alliane with France. Britan only joined due to the alliane with Belgium and France. France only joined due to past tensions in which Kaiser Wilhelm II didn't agree with France having to have some degree of control in Africa and invading Morocco and also due to the fact they got invaded. This emphaises how the Alliance system was the main reason for the first World War as if there was no alliances the first World War might not even have happened. And USA only joined the war due to their ships being constantly sunk and due to a good relationship with Britain.","The student provides a range of examples to support the argument that the Alliance System was the main cause of the First World War. They mention Russia's support for Bosnia, Germany's Blank Cheque to Austria-Hungary, Britain's involvement due to the invasion of Belgium, and the alliances between Russia, France, and Britain. These points demonstrate specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question.

However, the explanation of each factor is somewhat brief and lacks the depth required for a developed explanation. The student does not fully explore the complexities of the alliances or the broader context of European rivalries and tensions. The reasoning is coherent but not fully substantiated, and the structure could be more logical and focused.

To reach Level 3, the student would need to provide a more developed explanation of the stated factor and other factors, supported by detailed factual knowledge and understanding. They should also aim to demonstrate a sustained line of reasoning with coherence and logical structure.

And USA only joined the war due to their ships being constantly sunk and due to a good relationship with Britain.","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's assess the student's answer for Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG):

### Analysis:

1. **Spelling:**
   - Correct: ""alliances,"" ""relationships,"" ""example,"" ""Russia,"" ""Austria-Hungary,"" ""Germany,"" ""conflict,"" ""British,"" ""Belgium,"" ""isolationism,"" ""tension,"" ""France,"" ""Kaiser Wilhelm II,"" ""Africa,"" ""Morocco,"" ""USA,"" ""ships,"" ""Britain.""
   - Incorrect: ""act"" (contextually should be ""act on behalf of""), ""Blank Cheque"" (should be ""blank cheque""), ""isolationaism"" (should be ""isolationism""), ""alliane"" (should be ""alliance""), ""Britan"" (should be ""Britain""), ""emphaises"" (should be ""emphasizes""), ""first World War"" (should be ""First World War"").

2. **Punctuation:**
   - Correct: Use of commas and periods is generally accurate.
   - Incorrect: Missing commas for clarity, e.g., ""relationships, an example being Russia wanting to help Bosnia act against Austria-Hungary due to them having a lot of 'Slavic brothers and sisters' in the country, however Germany gave Austria-Hungary a Blank Cheque which eventually led to Russia having to back out as they didn't want conflict with Germany."" This sentence is too long and could be broken up for better readability.

3. **Grammar:**
   - Correct: The overall meaning is clear, and the student uses complex sentences effectively.
   - Incorrect: Some sentences are run-on and could be better structured for clarity. For example, ""Another example is the fact that the British only got involved due to the fact that Russia invaded Belgium and England had an alliance with Belgium, which caused England to come out of their isolationaism."" This sentence is confusing and contains factual inaccuracies (Russia did not invade Belgium; Germany did).

4. **Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as ""alliances,"" ""Blank Cheque,"" ""isolationism,"" ""Kaiser Wilhelm II,"" ""tensions,"" and ""First World War.""

### Conclusion:
- **Spelling and Punctuation:** The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy, though there are a few errors.
- **Grammar:** The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall, though some sentences are run-on and could be clearer.
- **Specialist Terms:** The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately.

Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer fits best in **Level 2**. The errors present do not significantly hinder the overall meaning, and the use of specialist terms is good.

1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Costs per Unit}}
     \]
   - The fixed costs are £10,000, the new selling price is £6.50 per unit, and the variable costs are £2.50 per unit.
   - Substituting these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

Now, let's compare this with the given Answer:

- The given Answer does not correctly use the formula for the break-even level of output.
- The calculations provided (5 x 4000 = 20000 and 6 x 3375 = 20000) do not align with the correct method for finding the break-even point.
- The final answer of 3375 units is incorrect and does not address the decrease in the break-even level of output.

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer identifies an advantage by stating, ""Retained profit is good for a small business as they save up little each month but eventually they will have a lot of money after saving up."" This aligns with the marking criteria of identifying an advantage. Therefore, 1 mark should be awarded for this part.

- **Explaining the advantage:**

This explanation is somewhat vague and does not directly align with the example answers provided in the mark scheme, such as ""Interest is not paid on retained profit"" or ""Retained profit does not dilute the ownership of the business.""

Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families.

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer does not directly outline a specific way financial information could help forecast success. Instead, it mentions understanding the target market and investment, which are not directly financial forecasting tools. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The points mentioned in the answer are not clearly linked. The statement ""understanding who their target market is"" is not directly connected to financial forecasting. The mention of ""how much they will invest into the business and how long it will take"" is also vague and lacks a clear link to financial forecasting tools like cash-flow forecasts or break-even analysis. Thus, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - Since the points are not linked and the answer does not provide a clear financial forecasting method, it can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark. However, even for 1 mark, the answer should at least mention a financial aspect, which it does not clearly do.

1. **First Aim: Completing Work to the Highest Standard**
   - The candidate states that Amelia aims to complete her work to the highest standard possible. This is developed through the idea that satisfied customers will recommend her to their families and friends, leading to more jobs and a successful business. This aligns with the indicative content that suggests Amelia's determination to succeed and the importance of customer recommendations.

2. **Second Aim: Unique Selling Point**
   - The candidate mentions Amelia's unique selling point of being a woman, which makes female customers feel more comfortable. This is a valid point and aligns with the indicative content that highlights the potential advantage of being a female business owner in a male-dominated industry.

**Application (AO2):**
- The response shows some application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the context of Amelia's plumbing business. The mention of high standards and customer recommendations is relevant to the context. However, the response lacks depth in explaining how these non-financial aims impact Amelia's decision to start the business.

Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","Using secondary market research is good for a small company like Lili Heating Ltd because it is free information which may help her advance in her small business. However, using secondary market research is bad for a small company like Lili Heating Ltd because it may not give her the information that she may of needed. Information is important for a small business as it helps the business who their target audience is.","The candidate's response identifies two impacts of using secondary market research for Lili Heating Ltd. The first impact is that it is ""free information,"" which is beneficial for a small company. This point is relevant but lacks further development or specific context related to Lili Heating Ltd. The second impact is that secondary market research ""may not give her the information that she may have needed,"" which is a valid point but again lacks detailed development and specific context.

In terms of application (AO2), the response is limited. The candidate mentions ""Lili Heating Ltd"" and ""small business,"" but there is no detailed application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the specific context of Amelia's plumbing business in Birmingham. The response does not mention any specific details from the context, such as the unique selling point of being a female plumber or the competitive market in Birmingham.

For analysis (AO3a), the response attempts to deconstruct the issue but finds limited connections between points. The points made are not interconnected with logical chains of reasoning. The response lacks depth and detailed analysis of how the use of secondary market research impacts Lili Heating Ltd.

Based on the mark scheme:

- **Level 1**: Limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context (AO2). Attempts to deconstruct business information and/or issues, finding limited connections between points (AO3a).

They state that Option 2 should be chosen because it will allow Amelia to get more jobs and make more profit. However, the explanation is superficial and does not demonstrate a detailed understanding of the business scenario.

  - 1","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",If there is a lack of wind then Ripple will not be creating energy for people who have signed up for energy.,"Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer states: ""If there is a lack of wind then Ripple will not be creating energy for people who have signed up for energy.""
   - This statement identifies a specific risk related to the variability of wind, which is crucial for the operation of a wind farm. If there is insufficient wind, the wind farm will not generate energy, which directly impacts the investors who rely on this energy supply.
   - The risk is clearly articulated and directly related to the context of Ripple's business model, which depends on wind energy to supply its customers.

### Evidence from the Context:
- The context mentions that Ripple is a wind farm providing green energy. The dependency on wind is implicit in the nature of a wind farm.
- The answer aligns with the context as it highlights a potential operational risk (lack of wind) that could affect energy production and, consequently, the return on investment for the investors.

### Comparison with Example Answers:
- The example answers provided in the mark scheme include risks such as ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" and ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy.""
- The given answer is similar in nature as it identifies a specific operational risk that could lead to a failure in energy production, which is a valid concern for investors.

### Conclusion:
- The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple, specifically the risk associated with the variability of wind, which is essential for energy production in a wind farm.
- This risk is directly relevant to the context of Ripple's business model and fits within the scope of the marking criteria.

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer states, ""they get a source of energy for cheaper than other brands,"" which is a valid benefit to customers.

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).
","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",I think Ripple should choose option 2 to provide free training if businesses recruit new employees so they can sell their electricity to more people so Ripple can make more electricity for more homes and it will be helping the environment as well. I think option 1 is bad because the company (Ripple) will make more money however it is not as good for the environment which is why Option 2 is a better option.,"The candidate begins by stating that Ripple should choose option 2, providing free training if businesses recruit new employees. This is a clear judgement, but the justification is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. The candidate mentions that this will allow Ripple to sell more electricity and help the environment, which shows some understanding of the business context (AO2). However, the explanation is not detailed and does not fully explore the implications or benefits of the option.

The candidate also briefly mentions why option 1 is not as favorable, stating that it is not as good for the environment. This shows an attempt at evaluation (AO3b), but the reasoning is limited and lacks interconnected points or detailed analysis.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a basic understanding of the business concepts and issues but lacks the depth and interconnected reasoning required for higher levels. The evaluation is present but is simple and not thoroughly developed.

Given these points, the answer fits the criteria for Level 1. The application of knowledge and understanding is limited, and the evaluation is basic.

This is a valid point and aligns with the indicative content that Ripple claims to supply energy cheaper than its competitors. However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed application to the business context (AO2). The candidate mentions that Ripple is an eco-friendly company with zero emissions, which is relevant but not directly related to the importance of price in the marketing mix.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In Source B, the picture shows a section Of British soldiers advencing under artilery bourrage. The picture was published in a British newspaper and and could be an awareness to show the changes of technology to the citizens of great Britain. In this case, the changes in technology could be the artillery due to its raw increase accuracy and fire rate. Another charge in technology was fighter planes. The way that the fighter get could damage people and find them was due to a savee secret compartment where they could throw bombs out of it creating the havoc among the soilders on the groud. Some planes had a camera attached to the plane so it could take a birds eye view picture to find and locate the exact co-ordinates to attack them. However, In Source C It tells the reader about a tank operator called Frank Mitchell who is writing about his experiences in the spring offensive in 1918. He was describing his experiences using tanks and how powerful they could be. They quickly destroyed German trench. Shows how this new machine could stop anything in its track and even was a defense mechanism to stop the new machine guns.

To an Historian these & other sources are both useful in there own use. Source B describes the way artillery barrage had become worse and more accurate to the enemy soldiers. Source C also shows the way new technology such as tanks can help the opposition win the war.","The student begins by describing the content of Source B, noting that it shows British soldiers advancing under an artillery barrage. They suggest that the picture was published to raise awareness among British citizens about technological advancements, specifically mentioning artillery and its increased accuracy and fire rate. The student also brings in some contextual knowledge about fighter planes, although this is not directly related to the source.

In the second paragraph, the student describes Source C, which is an account by Frank Mitchell, a tank commander, detailing his experiences during the German Spring Offensive in 1918. The student highlights the effectiveness of the new 'Whippet' tanks in destroying German soldiers and emphasizes the power and defensive capabilities of tanks.

The student attempts to evaluate the usefulness of both sources to a historian, noting that Source B shows the increased accuracy of artillery and Source C demonstrates the effectiveness of tanks. However, the evaluation is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth. The student does not fully explore the provenance of the sources or provide a detailed analysis of how these sources contribute to understanding military technology and tactics during the First World War.

To improve, the student could:
1. Provide a more detailed evaluation of the provenance of both sources, explaining why the fact that Source B was published in a British newspaper and Source C was written by a tank commander after the war is significant.
2. Include more specific contextual knowledge related to the sources, such as the development and impact of artillery tactics like the creeping barrage or the role of tanks in breaking the stalemate on the Western Front.
3. Discuss the relationship between the sources, such as how they together illustrate the evolution of military technology and tactics during the war.

Overall, the answer falls into Level 2 due to the simple evaluation of the content and some contextual knowledge. To reach Level 3, the student would need to provide extended reasoning related to utility and a more developed evaluation of the sources' content and provenance.

of Germany accessing France to
stop them attacking. This caused 
problems for both sides. For
France it was a problem for
the Germans attacking them and 
finding way around. For Germany
it was due to the alliances 
of France (which was Britain)
who were pushing them back
a few Km each time. This 
halted Germanys plans for
a few day but they kept
pushing to get passed the 
British troops. But they kept
getting pushed back until
eventually the Germans
broke through and attack britain 
troops. This led to a problem
for the british due to the fact
that the Germans were attacking 
them and cause a large
amount of fatal injury and 
death.","The student's answer demonstrates a basic understanding of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, but it lacks the depth and detail required for higher levels. The response is fragmented and does not present a coherent narrative or structured account. 

The student identifies some causes and consequences, such as the German advance and the involvement of British troops, but these points are not developed with specific factual knowledge or detailed analysis. The answer remains at a general level, with statements like ""the Germans were attacking them and cause a large amount of fatal injury and death,"" which do not provide the necessary depth or accuracy.

To reach Level 2, the student would need to present a more structured account with specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. For example, they could explain how the German advance through Belgium was slowed down by fighting Belgian and British troops and how this led to the need for both sides to build trenches.

The main two alliances were the triple alliance which involved Germany Austria-Hungary, and Italy and the 'triple Entente' consisted of Russia, France and Britain. The morrocon Crisis could also include the alliances because it forced Britain to get involved when Germany decided to ignore there heed of war. The collapse of the Ottoman empire could also be a cause of the main cause. because Austria Hungary attacked Serbia it got Russia involved and then got Germany involved due to their alliance.

","The student begins by acknowledging the Alliance System as a cause of the First World War but also mentions other potential causes. This shows an attempt to consider multiple factors, which is a good start.

In the second paragraph, the student identifies the two main alliances: the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente. They also mention the Moroccan Crisis and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, but these points are not fully developed or clearly linked to the question. The explanation of how the alliances brought other countries into the conflict is present but lacks depth and specific factual knowledge.

The third paragraph briefly mentions the ""blank cheque"" given by Germany to Austria-Hungary, which is a relevant point. However, the explanation is not fully developed, and the significance of this action is not clearly explained.

","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, I will assess the student's answer focusing on Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG).

### Analysis:

1. **Spelling:**
   - Correct: ""Alliance System,"" ""First World War,"" ""several,"" ""main cause,"" ""power,"" ""global domination,"" ""France,"" ""Germany,"" ""alliances,"" ""Germany,"" ""Austria-Hungary,"" ""Italy,"" ""Russia,"" ""Britain,"" ""Ottoman empire,"" ""Serbia,"" ""argument,"" ""brotherhood,"" ""combination,"" ""opinion,"" ""massive factor,"" ""loyalty,"" ""betrayal.""
   - Incorrect: ""world"" (should be ""World""), ""Keiser Wilhehms"" (should be ""Kaiser Wilhelm's""), ""morocco"" (should be ""Moroccan""), ""morrocon"" (should be ""Moroccan""), ""there"" (should be ""their""), ""heed"" (should be ""threat""), ""alliances is"" (should be ""alliances are"").

2. **Punctuation:**
   - Correct: Use of commas and periods in most places.
   - Incorrect: Missing commas in lists (e.g., ""Germany Austria-Hungary, and Italy"" should be ""Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy""), inconsistent use of quotation marks (e.g., ""main cause"" vs. 'triple Entente'), and a period after ""main cause"" in ""cause. because"" should be a comma or the sentence should be restructured.

3. **Grammar:**
   - Correct: General sentence structure is understandable.
   - Incorrect: ""These parts can could conform"" (should be ""These parts could consist""), ""the alliances is"" (should be ""the alliances are""), ""the morrocon Crisis could also include the alliances because it forced Britain to get involved when Germany decided to ignore there heed of war"" (should be ""the Moroccan Crisis could also involve the alliances because it forced Britain to get involved when Germany decided to ignore their threat of war""), ""the collapse of the Ottoman empire could also be a cause of the main cause"" (should be ""the collapse of the Ottoman Empire could also be a contributing factor""), ""It is in fact the main cause"" (should be ""It is, in fact, the main cause"").

4. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses several specialist terms such as ""Alliance System,"" ""First World War,"" ""Kaiser Wilhelm,"" ""Moroccan Crisis,"" ""Triple Alliance,"" ""Triple Entente,"" ""Ottoman Empire,"" ""blank cheque,"" and ""Austria-Hungary.""

### Conclusion:
The student's answer demonstrates a reasonable level of spelling, punctuation, and grammar accuracy, with some errors that do not significantly hinder the overall meaning. The use of specialist terms is good, though not extensive.

Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer fits best in **Level 2**. The errors present are not severe enough to drop it to Level 3, and the overall control of meaning is maintained.

1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The candidate correctly calculated the contribution per unit by subtracting the variable cost from the new selling price: \(6.50 - 2.50 = 4\). This is correct.
   - The candidate then correctly used this contribution to find the new break-even level of output: \(10000 / 4 = 2500\). This is also correct.
   - Therefore, the candidate has correctly substituted into the formula and calculated the new break-even level of output.

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The candidate correctly identified the new break-even level of output as 2500 units.
   - However, the candidate did not explicitly calculate the decrease in the break-even level of output, which should be \(4000 - 2500 = 1500\) units.

Given the marking criteria:
- Substitution into the correct formula and correct calculation of the new break-even level of output: 1 mark.
- Correct calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output: 1 mark.

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer does not clearly identify an advantage. The phrase ""more customers"" is vague and does not directly link to meeting legal obligations. The mark scheme expects a clear identification such as ""A small business would not get sued for breaking the law"" or ""Employees will feel that the business is taking good care of them."" Therefore, this criterion is not met. **(0 marks)**

- **Explanation of the advantage:**
  - The explanation provided is unclear and lacks depth. The candidate mentions ""if you had a level 5 health and safety which is a legal obligations more people might want to try and buy your product,"" but this is not a well-developed explanation. The mark scheme expects a more detailed explanation, such as ""This means the business would not have to face financial consequences such as a fine"" or ""Therefore, the business will have a more motivated workforce."" The candidate's response does not sufficiently explain how meeting legal obligations leads to more customers. **(0 marks)**

Overall, the answer does not meet the criteria set out in the mark scheme. The identification of the advantage is vague, and the explanation is not well-developed or clear.

#### Marking Criteria: Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - **Criteria:** The answer must state one of the elements of the marketing mix (Product, Place, Promotion, or People) and apply it to Lili Heating Ltd.
   - **Evaluation:** The answer ""Advertising"" falls under the ""Promotion"" element of the marketing mix. The Mark Scheme example ""Promotion methods to attract female customers"" supports that ""Promotion"" is a valid element. Therefore, the answer satisfies this criterion.

#### Marking Notes: To award 1 mark there must be evidence of application.

2. **Evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - **Criteria:** The answer must show how the element of the marketing mix is specifically applied to Lili Heating Ltd.
   - **Evaluation:** The answer ""Advertising"" does not provide specific evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd. The context mentions that Amelia thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families, but the answer does not explicitly connect to this context. Therefore, the answer does not fully satisfy this criterion.

### Conclusion:
- The answer ""Advertising"" correctly identifies an element of the marketing mix (Promotion), but it lacks specific application to Lili Heating Ltd as required by the marking notes.

  example_answer: 
    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.

Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","Option 2 because social media is a great advertising resource to promote a business as this may bring in new customers, promoting there work and showcasing as well. Option 1: sounds very sexist as its only a discount for women not men as this may bring hate or bad reviews into the business.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 2 should be chosen, providing a brief justification that social media is a great advertising resource. This demonstrates some application of knowledge (AO2), but it is not detailed or specific to the context of Lili Heating Ltd. The candidate then briefly mentions Option 1, suggesting it sounds sexist and could bring negative reviews, which shows an attempt at evaluation (AO3b), but it is not well-developed or supported by detailed reasoning.

The answer lacks interconnected points and logical chains of reasoning (AO3a). The analysis is superficial and does not delve into the specifics of how social media could benefit Amelia's business or the potential drawbacks of offering discounts only to female customers. The judgement provided is simple and based on limited evaluation.

Overall, the answer demonstrates limited understanding of the business scenario and provides basic analysis with minimal justification. Therefore, it fits the criteria for Level 1.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer provided is ""stock market crash.""
   - The Mark Scheme requires the risk to be specific to Ripple and its context as an energy company providing green and renewable energy.
   - The example answers in the Mark Scheme include risks directly related to the business operations of Ripple, such as ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" and ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy.""
   - The answer ""stock market crash"" is a general risk that could apply to any investment and does not specifically relate to Ripple's business model or the context provided.

### Conclusion:
- The answer ""stock market crash"" does not fulfill the criteria of stating a specific risk for investors in Ripple as per the context provided.
- The answer lacks application to the specific business model and context of Ripple.

### Marks Awarded:
- 0 marks (out of 1 possible mark)

### Rationale:
- The answer does not provide a risk that is specific to Ripple's operations or context as required by the Mark Scheme.
- The risk mentioned is too general and not directly applicable to the unique aspects of Ripple's business model as described in the context.

    - As Ripple grows it will need to employ new people in line with the government target of 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector. As these are new jobs there will be a need for training to develop new skills. (AO2).
    - If Ripple pays less tax to the government then it would have more retained profit to invest into the business. This could result in cheaper energy being provided to its members. As a result, Ripple may attract more investment and could then expand into other green business ideas (AO3a).

  progression:
    - Students can progress to this level by demonstrating thorough and detailed understanding with logically connected reasoning and clear justifications.
  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B is useful to a historian because it shows a tactic called creeping barrage. This tactic was made so that Britain could gain some land and push the Germans back. In the picture it shows that artillery shells would be fired in front of the troops which would be giving the troops cover to jump into shell holes. This tactic worked majority of the times, but had one big problem. The shells were going so close that if they were fired wrong then they would kill their own soldiers.

Source C is useful to a historian because it talks about the development of tanks. At first tanks were slow which made them an easy target for the germans. The british used the tanks in large groups followed by soldiers. The tanks would provide cover for soldiers and they could destroy barbed wire so the troops could get through later on tanks were improved they were faster and better weapons on board for example bigger shells and turrets. The turrets meant that they could fire fast and in 360°. ","The student provides a basic analysis of both sources, identifying relevant features and explaining their significance. For Source B, the student explains the tactic of the creeping barrage and its purpose, as well as the potential risks involved. For Source C, the student discusses the development and use of tanks, highlighting their initial limitations and subsequent improvements.

However, the evaluation of the sources is quite simple and lacks depth. The student does not provide much contextual knowledge or detailed analysis of the provenance of the sources. For example, they do not discuss the significance of Source B being published in a British newspaper in 1917 or the fact that Source C is an account from a tank commander published after the war.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed evaluation, including more contextual knowledge and a deeper analysis of the provenance of the sources. They should also consider the relationship between the sources and how they complement each other in providing a fuller picture of military technology and tactics in the First World War.

But this meant that the Germans had to go through Belgium which they thought wouldn't be a problem. However, as they came to the Belgium border they refused to let the Germans through. The Germans then declared war on Belgium. This was a bad decision for Germany as now Britain joined to protect the Belgians. They had eventually got through Belgium and arrived at the French border. 
 
They then declared war on France. The British then asks for Americas help which then meant that the Germans had another army to fight. By this time Russia had mobilized and declared war on Germany. This created a problem for the germans as they were fighting two wars on two fronts which meant that the schlieffen plan had failed.","The student identifies several key points about the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, moving beyond level 1 by providing specific knowledge and understanding. The answer is presented in a structured account, with events in chronological order, which places it in level 2. The student explains how the German advance through Belgium led to Britain joining the war and how the plan's failure resulted in Germany fighting on two fronts.

However, the analysis remains relatively simple and lacks the depth and detail required for higher levels. The student does not fully develop the consequences of these events or provide a range of accurate factual knowledge. For example, there is no mention of the Battle of the Marne or the resulting stalemate and trench warfare on the Western Front, which are crucial to understanding the full impact of the Schlieffen Plan's failure.

To reach level 3, the student would need to provide a more developed analysis, linking each stage of the narrative to the consequences for the war.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```",Sources B and C are useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War as in source B they show the advancement of technology and show how Britian attacked the Germans. It also gives them a picture of actually what it would have looked like in no mans land. Source C is also useful as it shows that tanks made a massive impact in the war and were very powerful. This shows that tanks were very effective and are useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in World War One.,"The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides a basic analysis of their content. For Source B, they mention the advancement of technology and how Britain attacked the Germans, and for Source C, they highlight the impact and effectiveness of tanks. However, the analysis is quite simplistic and lacks depth. There is no detailed factual knowledge or extended reasoning related to the utility of the sources. The provenance of the sources is not evaluated, and the relationship between the sources is not considered.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed factual knowledge, evaluate the provenance of the sources, and offer extended reasoning related to their utility. They should also consider the relationship between the sources and how they complement each other in providing a comprehensive understanding of military technology and tactics in the First World War.

They also estimated that it would take the Russians 10 weeks to mobilize but this happened much sooner and caused Germany to have to fight the war on two fronts. Due to their poor estimations and assumptions, this led to huge problems as the Germans couldn't afford to fight the war on two fronts. They struggled getting food and supplies to both fronts and were slowly being worn down and soldiers began to die of starvation. ","The student identifies the key points of the Schlieffen Plan and its failure, moving beyond level 1 by demonstrating basic knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The answer is presented in a structured account, showing specific knowledge such as the underestimation of Russian mobilization and the resulting two-front war, which places it in level 2. 

However, the analysis remains relatively simple, focusing on the immediate consequences without delving into more detailed causation or the broader impact on the war. To reach level 3, the student would need to provide a more developed analysis, including sequencing and reasoning supported by a range of accurate factual knowledge.

Firstly as Russia, USA and Britain formed an alliance this could have caused Germany massive problems as they were now outstrengthened as they have far less soldiers and supplies than the triple alliance had which made a huge impact as more weapons and vehicles could be made but not for the Germans. The main cause of the world war could have been the assassination of Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand. The Duke was visiting Sarajevo, Bosnia. Serbia formed a group called the black hand which was a group of young men and they planned to assassinate Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand. They all lined up in different positions on the street the Duke was driving down, the first guy threw a hand grenade which failed, so he drank poison and jumped into water which turned out to only be about 3 feet deep so he didn't drown and was then arrested. All the other young men failed too, so they met up and were annoyed that the plan failed. One of the men walked to the shop and got a sandwich. Coincidentally the Arch Dukes car had made a wrong turning and was now driving straight towards him so he pulled his gun out and shot him and his wife who both later died in hospital. This caused countries to start declaring war on eachother and then their allies got involved and started the first world war.   ","The student begins by addressing the stated factor, the Alliance System, and explains how it could have caused tension between countries. They mention the alliances formed by Russia, USA, and Britain, and how this could have posed a problem for Germany. However, the explanation lacks depth and specific factual knowledge, such as the names of the alliances (Triple Entente and Triple Alliance) and the historical context behind their formation.

The student then shifts focus to another factor, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, providing a detailed narrative of the event. While the account is accurate and detailed, it lacks a clear explanation of how this assassination led to the broader conflict of World War I. The student does not connect the assassination to the subsequent declarations of war and the involvement of the alliances, which would have strengthened their argument.

The answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding of the factors leading to World War I but lacks the developed reasoning and coherence required for higher levels. The explanation of the Alliance System is too brief and lacks specific details, while the narrative of the assassination, although detailed, does not clearly link to the broader causes of the war.

Overall, the answer falls into Level 1 due to its basic explanation of the factors and lack of developed reasoning. To reach higher levels, the student would need to provide more detailed knowledge and understanding of the Alliance System and its impact, as well as a clearer explanation of how the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand led to the involvement of the alliances and the outbreak of World War I.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Both Sources are useful to a historian. Source B is an image that was published in the British newspaper, October 1917. The image shows how Britain used creeping barrage and technology to fight the Germans. These new tactics worked very well for the Allies and stopped the stalemate. Planes are also shown in the picture and they were a brilliant piece of technology Britain used. The planes could see from above where the soldiers needed to attack and if there are any weak points. Source C is about Frank Mitchell's experience during the German Spring Offensive. He says his tank Was stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack his tank. On his right seven tanks turned up and sent the soldiers running in different directions. This shows us how effective tanks were in the first word war. In Source C he also says seven of our newest tanks. This tells us Britain has been making more tanks and will probably keep making progress like they did then. ","The student demonstrates an understanding of both sources and provides some analysis of their content. For Source B, the student identifies the use of ""creeping barrage"" and the role of planes, explaining their significance in breaking the stalemate. For Source C, the student describes Frank Mitchell's account of the effectiveness of tanks during the German Spring Offensive, highlighting the development and impact of new tank models.

However, the evaluation of the sources' utility is somewhat limited. The student does not fully explore the provenance of the sources or provide detailed contextual knowledge to support their analysis. The evaluation of Source B could be strengthened by discussing the significance of the source being published in a British newspaper in 1917, and how it might reflect public perception or propaganda efforts. Similarly, the evaluation of Source C could benefit from a deeper exploration of Frank Mitchell's background and the context of his account.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed and developed evaluation of both the content and provenance of the sources, supported by contextual knowledge. They should also aim to make more explicit connections between the sources and their utility to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan was an idea a German General created at the start of the first World War. He planned it would take Russia six weeks to prepare for war, so they quickly wanted to defeat France. When the Schlieffen plan was put into action Germany didn't want to fight France at the border as it was heavily fortified. Germany decided to invade Belgium up North then get to France. Belgium was neutral and no body expected Germany to do this. However Germany expected that Belgium would let them pass but they put up a good fight and slowed down the Germans. This gave Russia more time and France could get their troops up north. Soon after Germany invaded Belgium, Britain joined the war as they had an agreement. Britain joining the War was terrible for Germany as they were a strong nation with a big military. Russia also declared they where ready for war way quicker than Germany expected. Germany now had to fight Britian, France and Russia at the same time. That is how the Schieiffen Plan failed.","The student provides a structured account of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, moving beyond basic statements to show a simple analysis of causation and consequence. The answer includes specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question, such as the plan's reliance on a quick defeat of France, the invasion of Belgium, and the unexpected resistance from Belgium. The student also mentions the involvement of Britain and the quicker-than-expected mobilization of Russia, which are key points in understanding why the plan failed.

However, the answer lacks the depth and range of accurate and detailed knowledge required for higher levels. The analysis is straightforward and does not delve into the complexities of the situation, such as the strategic miscalculations or the broader implications of the plan's failure, like the resulting stalemate and trench warfare.

To reach Level 3, the student would need to develop the analysis further, providing more detailed factual knowledge and reasoning. For example, they could explain how the failure of the Schlieffen Plan led to a prolonged stalemate on the Western Front and the digging of trenches, which significantly impacted the course of the war.

This caused massive tension between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary wanted to go to war with Serbia however Serbia was close allies with Russia and Austria-Hungary didn't want a war with Russia. Austria-Hungary asked Germany if they would back them up and Germany agreed to do so. This caused tension between Germany and Russia.

The Moroccan Crisis had a big effect on why the first word war began. France wanted Control of Morocco and with Britain and France being allies, Britain encouraged France to do so. The German Kaiser wanted an Empire and so taking Morocco would be a good start. He believed Germany should have Morocco and he even visited it. A Conference took place in Algiers to decide who should have Morocco. Most Countries agreed France should take control and Germany was humiliated. The Kaiser was furious and tensions were rising between France and Germany. ","The student begins by addressing the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which is a relevant factor but not directly related to the Alliance System. The explanation of the assassination and its immediate consequences is accurate but lacks depth and does not fully connect to the broader context of the Alliance System.

The second paragraph discusses the Moroccan Crisis, which is another relevant factor but again, not directly related to the Alliance System. The explanation is accurate and shows some understanding of the tensions between France and Germany, but it does not fully develop the reasoning or connect it to the main question about the Alliance System.

The student does not provide a complex explanation of the Alliance System itself or how it contributed to the outbreak of the First World War. There is no discussion of the Triple Alliance and Triple Entente, or how these alliances created a framework for conflict. Additionally, the student does not compare the importance of the Alliance System to other factors, which is necessary for a higher-level response.

Overall, the answer demonstrates some specific knowledge and understanding of relevant events but lacks a coherent and structured line of reasoning that directly addresses the question.

### Analysis:

1. **Spelling:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors:
     - ""assainated"" should be ""assassinated.""
     - ""word"" should be ""world"" in ""the first word war.""
   - These errors are relatively minor and do not significantly hinder understanding.

2. **Punctuation:**
   - The student uses punctuation with considerable accuracy, but there are some issues:
     - The sentence ""I agree with this statement To some extent."" should have ""To"" in lowercase.
     - The sentence ""Due to a Serbian group called 'Black Hand' the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne (Franz Ferdinand) was assainated in Sarajevo."" could benefit from a comma after ""Black Hand.""
     - The sentence ""Austria-Hungary wanted to go to war with Serbia however Serbia was close allies with Russia and Austria-Hungary didn't want a war with Russia."" should have a comma after ""Serbia.""
   - These punctuation errors are minor and do not significantly hinder understanding.

3. **Grammar:**
   - The student generally uses grammar with good control of meaning overall.
   - There are a few grammatical issues:
     - ""Serbia was close allies with Russia"" should be ""Serbia was a close ally of Russia.""
     - ""The German Kaiser wanted an Empire and so taking Morocco would be a good start."" could be clearer if rephrased to ""The German Kaiser wanted an empire, and taking Morocco would be a good start.""
   - These grammatical issues do not significantly hinder the overall meaning.

4. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately, such as ""Black Hand,"" ""Franz Ferdinand,"" ""Austro-Hungarian,"" ""Moroccan Crisis,"" ""Kaiser,"" and ""Algiers.""

### Conclusion:
The student's answer demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, with minor errors that do not significantly hinder understanding. The grammar is generally controlled, and the use of specialist terms is appropriate and varied.

### Marks Awarded:
Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer fits well within **Level 2**. The minor errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar prevent it from reaching Level 1, but the overall control of meaning and use of specialist terms justify awarding the higher end of Level 2.

### Answer Breakdown:
1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The candidate correctly identifies the formula for break-even point: \( \text{Break-even point} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per unit} - \text{Variable Costs per unit}} \).
   - They correctly substitute the new selling price into the formula: \( \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = 2,500 \) units.

2. **Correct calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The candidate correctly calculates the new break-even point as 2,500 units.
   - They then correctly calculate the decrease in the break-even level of output: \( 4,000 - 2,500 = 1,500 \) units.

- **Identification of an advantage:**

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer states, ""Financial information gives Amelia an idea on what she needs to spend money to begin the business and what she could use to improve the business's standards."" This outlines a general way financial information could help forecast success by indicating necessary expenditures and potential improvements. However, it lacks specific financial tools or forecasts that could be used, such as cash-flow forecasts or break-even analysis, which are mentioned in the mark scheme's example answers. Therefore, this criterion is partially met but lacks depth and specificity.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The points in the answer are somewhat linked. The statement connects the idea of financial information to spending and improving business standards. However, the linkage is not strong or detailed enough to fully meet the criteria for 2 marks. The answer does not provide a clear, linked development that shows how financial information directly helps forecast success in a detailed manner, such as ensuring cash flow or setting profit targets.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - Given that the points are not strongly linked and the answer lacks specific financial tools or forecasts, it falls under the category of unlinked points. Therefore, it should be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

  - Amelia may want to gain more independence after working for someone else for six years (AO2).

Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet.

Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","One of Amelia's non financial aims may be personal satisfaction. This may keep her motivated because she is working what she wants to do. This leads to an increase in motivation which allows her to make more money as she feels she can do more plumbings. 

Another non-financial aim of Amelia's choice could be independence. Being independent allows her to work her own working hours and may allow her to be creative with it as she has no boss. This may increase productivity as she can work whenever she feels like it. This also will lead to her feeling more motivated to work.","The candidate identifies two non-financial aims: personal satisfaction and independence. 

1. **Personal Satisfaction:**
   - The candidate states that personal satisfaction may keep Amelia motivated because she is working in a field she enjoys. This is developed through the idea that increased motivation allows her to make more money as she feels she can do more plumbing work. However, the link between personal satisfaction and increased earnings is not fully explained, and the reasoning lacks depth.

2. **Independence:**
   - The candidate mentions that independence allows Amelia to work her own hours and be creative since she has no boss. This is developed through the idea that increased productivity results from working whenever she feels like it, leading to more motivation. This point is more clearly developed than the first, but still lacks detailed interconnected points and logical chains of reasoning.

**Application (AO2):**
- The response includes some contextual elements such as ""working what she wants to do"" and ""no boss,"" but it lacks specific references to the context provided, such as the competitive market in Birmingham or the unique selling point of being a female plumber.

**Analysis (AO3a):**
- The response attempts to deconstruct the impact of non-financial aims but does so with limited connections between points. The reasoning is somewhat superficial and lacks the depth required for higher levels.

- The response demonstrates limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the context (Level 1 for AO2).

  example_answer: 
    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","I have chosen option 1.
If she offers a discounted price to female customers, more females will feel inclined to pay for her service as she is offering an exclusive deal to a specific group of people. This may lead Amelia's business to have a higher share in the market which can increase profit.

However, this idea seems wrong, as it is unfair to male customers. If this decision is made, a large proportion of male customers will be attracted to other plumbing businesses in the market. This may lead to an increase in competition in the market that Amelia may not be able to handle.

It also may reduce the reputation of her business and make it seem unacceptable. A decrease in reputation can lead to less customers willing to pay for their service which ultimately ends the business with failure. To conclude, Amelia may face many problems with this choice but it is still a high risk high reward choice. Since it's a Ltd, she won't lose any personal assets meaning she can take more risks.","The candidate begins by stating their choice of Option 1, which is to offer a discounted price to female customers. They provide some application of business concepts (AO2) by discussing how this could lead to a higher market share and increased profit. However, the application is somewhat limited and lacks detailed contextualization specific to Lili Heating Ltd.

The candidate then attempts to deconstruct the business information (AO3a) by considering the potential drawbacks of this option, such as it being unfair to male customers and possibly increasing competition. They also mention the potential negative impact on the business's reputation. However, the analysis is somewhat superficial and lacks interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning.

The candidate makes a judgement (AO3b) by concluding that the choice is high risk but high reward, and notes that as an Ltd, Amelia won't lose personal assets, allowing her to take more risks. This judgement is based on a limited evaluation of the business information and issues relevant to the choice made.

Overall, the answer demonstrates limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context, with attempts at basic analysis and a simple judgement.

","Let's evaluate the given Answer against the Mark Scheme criteria:

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The Answer states: ""the energy may not be reliable as the windmills depend on wind which is different at different times of the day.""
   - This statement identifies a risk related to the reliability of energy production due to the variability of wind, which is a valid concern for investors in a wind farm.
   - The Mark Scheme example answers include risks such as ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" and ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs."" The given Answer aligns with the latter example, as unreliable energy production could lead to insufficient energy supply for investors' needs.
   - Therefore, the Answer successfully states a risk for investors in Ripple.

### Conclusion:
The Answer fulfills the criteria by stating a risk related to the reliability of energy production due to wind variability. This is a valid risk for investors in a wind farm, as per the context and the example answers provided in the Mark Scheme.

This will keep the customers satisfied.","**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer states, ""If Ripple understands their customer needs, they can set their business and offer the customers what they need."" This implies a benefit to customers as Ripple will tailor their services to meet customer needs, which is a valid point. However, the benefit is not explicitly clear or specific to the context of Ripple's green energy plans. The mark scheme example answers provide specific benefits such as receiving the correct green energy plan or the correct amount of energy for their needs. The answer does not clearly outline a specific benefit to the customers in the context of Ripple's services. Therefore, this criterion is partially met.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer continues with, ""This will keep the customers satisfied."" This provides some development by explaining the outcome of Ripple understanding customer needs. However, the development is generic and lacks specific application to Ripple's context, such as how understanding needs leads to better energy plans or investment returns. The mark scheme requires linked development with evidence of application, which is not fully demonstrated here. Therefore, this criterion is not fully met.

**Overall Assessment:**
- The answer provides a general benefit but lacks specific context and detailed development. It does not fully meet the criteria for linked points with evidence of application.

    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

People may like this idea and want to pay for their services leading to profit made.

It is also beneficial for Ripple as they can spend this money on primary research. Having primary data allows Ripple to have a deeper understanding of customers and the market. They can use this data to improve their business as a whole which leads to an increase for survival.

However, other small businesses like Ripple pay less tax meaning other small companies in this market can benefit from this by improving their business with this money. This leads to an increase in competition between competitors which may be too overwhelming for Ripple to handle.

To conclude, Ripple has its own USP as it uses renewable energy that doesn't harm the environment. If they use the extra money wisely, they can come out more successful than the rest of the market.","The candidate begins by stating that they have chosen Option 1, which is a clear indication of their judgement. They provide some application (AO2) by discussing how Ripple can use the extra money to create more windmills and conduct primary research. This shows an understanding of the business context, but the application is not detailed enough to be considered thorough.

The analysis (AO3a) is present but somewhat limited. The candidate mentions that spending money on primary research can help Ripple understand customers and the market better, which can improve the business. However, the reasoning is not fully developed, and there are logical gaps in the explanation.

The evaluation (AO3b) is also present but limited. The candidate acknowledges that other small businesses might also benefit from paying less tax, which could increase competition. They conclude by stating that Ripple has a unique selling proposition (USP) and can be successful if they use the extra money wisely. However, the evaluation lacks depth and does not thoroughly consider the implications of the chosen option.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a basic understanding of business concepts and makes some connections between points, but it lacks the depth and detail required for higher levels. The answer fits best in Level 1, as it provides a simple justification based on limited evaluation of business information and issues relevant to the choice made.

The method of the customers being promoted to members of the business is very simple. This makes it more convenient for the people which is also a customer's need. Making promotion more convenient for customers allows Ripple to add value to their service meaning they can increase profit which leads to further future success in the business.

This is very important as 

The way Ripple produces their energy is through renewable energy. As it mentions, it doesn't harm the environment but keeps it a healthier place. This is important because it stands out as their USP. Having a USP makes their business stand out amongst the market, which will attract customers. They can increase members paying for their service which leads to an increase in revenue. This increase in revenue is important as they can use the extra money on further development for the business.

Ripple is flexible with the way the price of their energy plans are set at. The amount of money customers can invest varies on their energy needs. This Is beneficial to the customers as they won't need to pay a fixed price where they could be wasting money. Also, Ripple claims their services are cheaper than other competitors. This will attract customers because customers aim to find the best value for their money. Ripple's pricing is crucial as it gives the customers a choice. This will lead to an increase in members because of the vast options they offer.
To conclude, Ripple's marketing mix helps form the type of business that they are. It will definitely help them in the survival of their business
","The candidate's response covers several aspects of Ripple's marketing mix, but it lacks focus on the importance of price specifically. Here is a detailed breakdown of the response:

1. **Place**:
   - The candidate discusses the location of the windmills in a remote area of South Wales, highlighting the benefit of customers not being disturbed. This is relevant but not directly related to the importance of price in the marketing mix.

2. **Promotion**:
   - The candidate mentions the simplicity of becoming a member, which adds convenience and value to the service. This is more related to promotion and customer experience rather than price.

3. **Product**:
   - The candidate discusses the use of renewable energy as Ripple's USP, which differentiates it from competitors. This is relevant to the product aspect of the marketing mix.

4. **Price**:
   - The candidate finally addresses price, noting that Ripple's pricing is flexible and claims to be cheaper than competitors. This is beneficial to customers and can attract more members. This section is directly relevant to the question.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The conclusion is vague and does not specifically address the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix. It generalizes the marketing mix's role in the business's survival.

**Evaluation**:
- **Knowledge and Understanding (AO1b)**: The candidate demonstrates some knowledge of business concepts but does not consistently use business terminology accurately. This places the response in Level 1.
- **Application (AO2)**: The application of knowledge to the business context is limited and inconsistent. The candidate touches on various aspects of the marketing mix but does not focus on price. This places the response in Level 1.
- **Analysis (AO3a)**: The candidate attempts to deconstruct business information but finds limited connections between points. The analysis is not detailed or interconnected. This places the response in Level 1.
- **Evaluation (AO3b)**: The candidate makes a judgement but provides a simple justification based on limited evaluation. The conclusion is not well-reasoned or thorough. This places the response in Level 1.

**Overall Level and Marks**:
- The response is placed in Level 1 due to limited application, analysis, and evaluation.

The candidate's response needs to identify a way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate and provide an explanation of that way.

**Marking Criteria:**

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The candidate states, ""The internet may affect location of a business because it might not always be accurate."" This does not clearly identify a specific way the internet affects the location choice of a business. The mark scheme examples include ways such as choosing a cheaper location due to e-commerce or needing a location with good internet connections. The candidate's response does not align with these examples or provide a clear alternative way. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate attempts to explain by stating, ""for example you can look at a site but that image might be years old so that location might not be suitable anymore."" This explanation is not directly related to how the internet affects the choice of location in a business context. The mark scheme examples focus on practical business considerations like cost savings from e-commerce or the necessity of good internet connections for communication. The candidate's explanation does not align with these examples or provide a clear, relevant explanation. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

**Example Answers for Reference:**
- ""The business could choose a cheaper location (1) because the business can use e-commerce (1). As a result, the business may not require a physical retail location (1).""
- ""The business will need to be in a location with good internet connections (1) because a business may need the internet to communicate with stakeholders (1). A location with a weak signal could cause barriers to communication for the business (1).""

1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is: 
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Costs per Unit}}
     \]
   - The student correctly substituted the values into the formula for the new selling price:
     \[
     \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]
   - However, the student made an error in their calculation:
     \[
     \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} \neq 1536
     \]
     The correct calculation should be:
     \[
     \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The correct decrease should be:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]
   - The student incorrectly calculated:

","**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer does not explicitly identify an advantage of using retained profit as a source of finance. The statement ""they save the profit they have made"" is more of a description rather than an identification of an advantage. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

- **Explaining the advantage:**
  - The answer attempts to explain the advantage by stating, ""the business could later use this money later in the business to maybe pay back a loan or upgrade products and quality."" This explanation suggests that retained profit can be used for future investments or financial obligations, which aligns with the idea that retained profit provides flexibility in financial planning. However, the explanation is somewhat vague and does not directly link to the specific advantages listed in the mark scheme, such as being a cheap source of finance or not diluting ownership.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers in the mark scheme provide clear and specific advantages, such as ""Retained profit is a cheap source of finance"" and ""Interest is not paid on retained profit."" The given answer does not clearly identify such specific advantages.

**Marking Notes:**
- According to the marking notes, answers that list more than one advantage with no explanation will be awarded a maximum of 1 mark. In this case, the answer does not list multiple advantages but rather provides a general explanation without a clear identification of an advantage.

**Total Marks:**
- Based on the criteria and the provided answer, the response does not fully meet the requirements for identification and explanation of an advantage. Therefore, the answer should be awarded 1 mark for the attempt to explain the use of retained profit, even though it lacks clarity and specificity.

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer states, ""Financial information could help the business as it can forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft."" This outlines a way financial information could help forecast success, but it is very general and lacks specific details. The marking criteria require a specific way, such as a cash-flow forecast or break-even analysis, which is not provided here. Therefore, this criterion is not fully satisfied.

It mentions that financial information can help forecast success and see if an overdraft is needed, but these points are not developed or linked in a meaningful way. The marking scheme example answers show linked points with specific financial tools and their implications, which this answer lacks. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

   - However, the Mark Scheme requires evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd. The Answer does not provide any specific application to Lili Heating Ltd, such as mentioning the specific products or services offered by the business (e.g., repairing/installing boilers).

### Example Answers from Mark Scheme:
- ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham"" (1)
- ""Promotion methods to attract female customers"" (1)
- ""Product is to repair/install boilers"" (1)

### Marking Notes:
- To award 1 mark, there must be evidence of application.

### Conclusion:
- The Answer correctly identifies ""products"" as an element of the marketing mix, but it lacks the necessary application to Lili Heating Ltd. The context provided in the question mentions specific services like repairing/installing boilers, which should have been included to meet the criteria fully.

Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families.

Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","Because it can create job opportunities meaning more people will have an income so they can pay their taxes and the government can spend money on country needs.
","**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer provides a linked point: ""it can create job opportunities"" and ""more people will have an income so they can pay their taxes."" This is a valid reason why the government would want the business to be successful, as it links job creation to tax revenue. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The points in the answer are linked. The creation of job opportunities is directly connected to more people having an income and paying taxes, which in turn allows the government to spend money on country needs. Thus, this criterion is not applicable as the points are linked.

- **Award any other valid answer. To award 2 marks there must be linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer provides linked development by explaining the chain of effects from job creation to tax revenue and government spending. However, there is no specific evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd or the context provided. The answer is generic and does not mention any specific details about the business, such as Amelia's unique selling point or the Birmingham area. Therefore, while the linked development is present, the lack of contextual application means it does not fully satisfy this criterion.

    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).

Also I strongly disagree to option 1 as men may find it offensive that women get a discount just because of their gender and may leave bad reviews on the business so it will gain a bad recognition and have less sales.
","The candidate begins by stating their choice of Option 2, providing a clear justification based on the low cost of social media promotion and the potential for increased recognition and sales. This demonstrates a sound application of business concepts and understanding of the business context (AO2). The candidate also considers the potential negative impact of Option 1, showing an attempt to deconstruct business information and issues, although the reasoning is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth (AO3a).

The analysis is somewhat limited, as the candidate does not provide detailed interconnected points or logical chains of reasoning. The evaluation is present but is based on a limited assessment of the information, focusing mainly on the potential negative reaction from male customers without exploring other possible implications (AO3b).

Overall, the answer demonstrates a sound understanding of the business scenario with some inconsistencies and provides interconnected points with some logical chains of reasoning. The judgement is justified but based on a limited evaluation. Therefore, this answer should be placed in Level 2.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer provided is: ""The amount of money that customers invest varies on their energy needs.""
   - This statement does not directly identify a risk for investors. Instead, it describes a characteristic of the investment process in Ripple, specifically how the investment amount is determined based on energy needs.
   - According to the mark scheme, a valid response should clearly state a risk, such as ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" or ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy.""
   - The provided answer does not mention any potential negative outcome or risk associated with the investment, such as financial loss, failure of the business, or insufficient energy supply.

- The answer does not satisfy the marking criteria as it fails to state a risk for investors in Ripple.
- Therefore, no marks should be awarded.

","**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer states, ""the business will understand more what customers want and can then provide that."" This is a valid point as it indicates that Ripple will be able to tailor its services to meet customer needs. However, the benefit to the customer is not explicitly clear in terms of how it directly impacts them. The mark scheme example answers focus on specific benefits such as receiving the correct green energy plan or the correct amount of energy for their needs. The answer does not clearly outline a direct benefit to the customer, so this criterion is not fully satisfied.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer attempts to provide linked development by stating, ""Therefor leading to more sales."" However, this development is more focused on the benefit to the business rather than the customer. The mark scheme requires the benefit to be customer-centric, such as getting the best return on their money or receiving the correct amount of energy. The answer lacks specific evidence of application to the customer's benefit, so this criterion is not fully satisfied.

    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",Price is very important in Ripples as they need to become members of the business before they can be supplied with energy. This means the business owners can have a more intimate relationship with their customers so they are loyal and keep coming back which can gain them more money. This method is also more trustworthy for the customers so they can feel they are part of a community.,"The candidate begins by discussing the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix, but the explanation is somewhat limited and lacks depth. The response mentions that customers need to become members before being supplied with energy, which is a relevant point. However, the candidate does not fully explore how price impacts Ripple's business model or its competitive advantage.

The candidate touches on the idea of building customer loyalty and trust, which is a valid point, but it is not sufficiently developed or linked back to the importance of price. There is a lack of detailed application of business concepts and issues to the context of Ripple (AO2). The response does not deconstruct business information or issues in a detailed manner, nor does it provide interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning (AO3a).

The conclusion is very brief and does not offer a well-reasoned judgement based on a thorough evaluation of business information and issues (AO3b). The response lacks the depth and detail required for higher levels of the mark scheme.

Overall, the response demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues, but with limited business terminology used (AO1b). The application of knowledge to the business context is limited, and the evaluation is simplistic.

Based on the mark scheme, this response fits into Level 1. The candidate demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding but does not fully develop their points or provide a detailed evaluation.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Sources B and C are very useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics. For example, Source B shows a new tactic developed in the war called a creeping barrage this is when artillery from very far behind shoot in front of their own men and the explosions give cover and make it easy for them to advance toward enemy trenches. Australia were very known for using this tactic and were very good at it, they would get really close to the artillery fire and advance very quickly. Source C is also useful to a historian as it is written by a tank commander which means it very reliable, another reason why source C is helpful is it showcases a newly developed weapon and illustrates how significant it was in the first world war. The source tells a short story on Frank Mitchell and how he was stuck bound to be attacked when seven of their newest, fastest tanks raced past called 'wippets'. The source also says about the tanks machine guns which had also been worked on alot during the first world war, the original machine gun the 'vickers gun' was very heavy so was mostly used stationary with a crew of six men operating it the new machine gun the lewis gun was much lighter and very easy to be operated by 1-2 men and was the first development of the assault rifle. ","The student demonstrates a good understanding of both sources and provides a detailed analysis of their content. For Source B, the student explains the concept of the creeping barrage and its effectiveness, mentioning Australia's proficiency with this tactic. This shows a clear understanding of the military tactics used during the First World War. For Source C, the student highlights the reliability of the source due to its author being a tank commander and provides a detailed account of the new tank technology, specifically the 'Whippets' and their impact on the battlefield. The student also discusses the development of machine guns, comparing the Vickers gun and the Lewis gun, which adds depth to the analysis.

However, the evaluation of the provenance of Source B is missing, and the evaluation of Source C's provenance could be more developed. The student does not explicitly link the content and provenance to the utility of the sources for a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War. To reach Level 4, the student would need to provide a more complex evaluation of both sources, including a discussion of their provenance and how it affects their utility. Additionally, the student should evaluate the relationship between the sources and how they together provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

Overall, the answer falls into Level 3 due to the developed evaluation of the content of both sources and the extended reasoning related to utility. However, the lack of a detailed evaluation of the provenance and the relationship between the sources prevents it from reaching Level 4.

The Franco-Prussian Alliance was the first of many between France and Russia, along with the Dual Alliance between Germany and Austria-Hungary these were the base alliances and when Italy joined the Dual Alliance to make it the Triple Alliance, Britain decided to join the Franco-Prussian Alliance to make it the Triple Alliance. Alliances could be a big cause of war because when two nations have a problem it makes it very easy for others to get dragged in this could then cause a large scale war this happened many times during the build up to World War One when a country has taken some land of someone elses and they wanted it back so other nations had to help. ","The student provides a basic explanation of the Alliance System, mentioning key alliances such as the Franco-Prussian Alliance, the Dual Alliance, and the Triple Alliance. However, the explanation lacks depth and specific factual knowledge. The student does not provide detailed information about the motives and rivalries that led to the formation of these alliances or how they contributed to the outbreak of World War I.

The answer does recognize the potential for alliances to escalate conflicts, but it does not develop this point with specific examples or detailed reasoning. The explanation remains at a basic level, without exploring other factors that contributed to the war or making a sustained judgement.

The Franco-Prussian Alliance was the first of many between France and Russia, along with the Dual Alliance between Germany and Austria-Hungary these were the base alliances and when Italy joined the Dual Alliance to make it the Triple Alliance, Britain decided to join the Franco-Prussian Alliance to make it the Triple Alliance. Alliances could be a big cause of war because when two nations have a problem it makes it very easy for others to get dragged in this could then cause a large scale war this happened many times during the build up to World War One when a country has taken some land of someone elses and they wanted it back so other nations had to help. ","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, here is the analysis of the student's answer:

### Spelling:
- The student spells most words correctly. There are no significant spelling errors that hinder understanding.

### Punctuation:
- The student uses punctuation, but there are some issues with comma placement and run-on sentences. For example, ""I somewhat agree with this statement, every european nation aligns itself with another to increase security."" should be split into two sentences for clarity.
- The sentence ""Alliances could be a big cause of war because when two nations have a problem it makes it very easy for others to get dragged in this could then cause a large scale war this happened many times during the build up to World War One when a country has taken some land of someone elses and they wanted it back so other nations had to help."" is a run-on sentence and could be broken down for better readability.

### Grammar:
- The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are some areas where the control of meaning could be improved. For example, ""when a country has taken some land of someone elses and they wanted it back so other nations had to help"" could be rephrased for clarity.
- The use of ""european"" should be capitalized to ""European.""

### Specialist Terms:
- The student uses some specialist terms such as ""Franco-Prussian Alliance,"" ""Dual Alliance,"" ""Triple Alliance,"" and ""World War One."" However, there is a mix-up in the alliances mentioned. The Franco-Prussian Alliance is incorrectly named; it should be the Franco-Russian Alliance.

### Overall Assessment:
- The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy, though there are some issues with punctuation and run-on sentences.
- The student uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, but there are areas where clarity could be improved.
- The student uses a limited range of specialist terms, with some inaccuracies.

Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer fits best in **Level 3**. The errors in punctuation and grammar do not significantly hinder the overall meaning, and the student uses a limited range of specialist terms.

```","Both Sources are useful to a historian. Source B is an image that was published in the British newspaper, October 1917. The image shows how Britain used creeping barrage and technology to fight the Germans. These new tactics worked very well for the Allies and stopped the stalemate. Planes are also shown in the picture and they were a brilliant piece of technology Britain used. The planes could see from above where the soldiers needed to attack and if there are any weak points. Source C is about Frank Mitchell's experience during the German Spring Offensive. He says his tank Was stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack his tank. On his right seven tanks turned up and sent the soldiers running in different directions. This shows us how effective tanks were in the first word war. In Source C he also says seven of our newest tanks. This tells us Britain has been making more tanks and will probably keep making progress like they did then.

He planned it would take Russia six weeks to prepare for war, so they quickly wanted to defeat France. When the Schlieffen plan was put into action Germany didn't want to fight France at the border as it was heavily fortified. Germany decided to invade Belgium up North then get to France. Belgium was neutral and no body expected Germany to do this. However Germany expected that Belgium would let them pass but they put up a good fight and slowed down the Germans. This gave Russia more time and France could get their troops up north. Soon after Germany invaded Belgium, Britain joined the war as they had an agreement. Britain joining the War was terrible for Germany as they were a strong nation with a big military. Russia also declared they where ready for war way quicker than Germany expected. Germany now had to fight Britian, France and Russia at the same time. That is how the Schieiffen Plan failed.","The student provides a structured account of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, moving beyond basic statements to show a simple analysis of causation and consequence. The answer includes specific knowledge and understanding, such as the plan's reliance on Russia taking six weeks to mobilize, the invasion of Belgium, and the unexpected resistance from Belgium. The student also mentions the involvement of Britain and the quicker-than-expected mobilization of Russia, which are relevant points.

However, the answer lacks the depth and range of accurate and detailed knowledge required for higher levels. The analysis is relatively straightforward and does not fully develop the sequencing and reasoning needed for Level 3. The student does not explore the broader implications of the plan's failure, such as the resulting stalemate and trench warfare on the Western Front.

This caused massive tension between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary wanted to go to war with Serbia however Serbia was close allies with Russia and Austria-Hungary didn't want a war with Russia. Austria-Hungary asked Germany if they would back them up and Germany agreed to do so. This caused tension between Germany and Russia.

The Moroccan Crisis had a big effect on why the first word war began. France wanted Control of Morocco and with Britain and France being allies, Britain encouraged France to do so. The German Kaiser wanted an Empire and so taking Morocco would be a good start. He believed Germany should have Morocco and he even visited it. A Conference took place in Algiers to decide who should have Morocco. Most Countries agreed France should take control and Germany was humiliated. The Kaiser was furious and tensions were rising between France and Germany.   
","The student begins by addressing the stated factor, the Alliance System, but does not provide a detailed explanation of how it contributed to the outbreak of the First World War. Instead, the response focuses on the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the resulting tensions between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, which is relevant but not directly tied to the Alliance System.

The second paragraph discusses the Moroccan Crisis, which is another relevant factor but is not explained in depth. The student mentions the involvement of France, Britain, and Germany, and the resulting humiliation of Germany, but does not fully develop the explanation of how this crisis contributed to the tensions leading to the war.

Overall, the response demonstrates some specific knowledge and understanding of relevant events but lacks a coherent and structured explanation of the stated factor and other factors. The answer does not reach the level of developed reasoning required for higher levels.

To improve, the student should:
1. Provide a detailed explanation of the Alliance System and how it contributed to the outbreak of the war.

Due to a Serbian group called 'Black Hand' the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne (Franz Ferdinand) was assainated in Sarajevo. This caused massive tension between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary wanted to go to war with Serbia however Serbia was close allies with Russia and Austria-Hungary didn't want a war with Russia. Austria-Hungary asked Germany if they would back them up and Germany agreed to do so. This caused tension between Germany and Russia.

The Moroccan Crisis had a big effect on why the first word war began. France wanted Control of Morocco and with Britain and France being allies, Britain encouraged France to do so. The German Kaiser wanted an Empire and so taking Morocco would be a good start. He believed Germany should have Morocco and he even visited it. A Conference took place in Algiers to decide who should have Morocco. Most Countries agreed France should take control and Germany was humiliated. The Kaiser was furious and tensions were rising between France and Germany.   
","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's assess the student's answer for Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG).

### Analysis:

1. **Spelling:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors:
     - ""assainated"" should be ""assassinated.""
     - ""word"" should be ""world"" in ""the first word war.""
   - These errors are relatively minor and do not significantly hinder understanding.

2. **Punctuation:**
   - The student uses punctuation with considerable accuracy, but there are some issues:
     - The phrase ""I agree with this statement To some extent"" should have ""To"" in lowercase.
     - The sentence ""Austria-Hungary wanted to go to war with Serbia however Serbia was close allies with Russia and Austria-Hungary didn't want a war with Russia"" should have a comma after ""Serbia"" and ""however.""
     - The sentence ""Austria-Hungary asked Germany if they would back them up and Germany agreed to do so"" could benefit from a comma after ""up.""
   - These punctuation errors are minor and do not significantly hinder the overall meaning.

3. **Grammar:**
   - The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are some issues:
     - ""Serbia was close allies with Russia"" should be ""Serbia was a close ally of Russia.""
     - ""The German Kaiser wanted an Empire and so taking Morocco would be a good start"" could be clearer with a comma after ""Empire.""
   - These grammatical errors do not significantly hinder the overall meaning.

4. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as ""Black Hand,"" ""Franz Ferdinand,"" ""Serbia,"" ""Austria-Hungary,"" ""Germany,"" ""Russia,"" ""Moroccan Crisis,"" ""Kaiser,"" and ""Algiers.""
   - The use of these terms is appropriate and enhances the explanation.

### Conclusion:
The student's answer demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling, punctuation, and grammar, with only minor errors that do not significantly hinder the overall meaning. The student also uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately.

### Marks Awarded:
Based on the criteria, the student's answer fits well within **Level 2**. Given the forgiving nature of the grading and the minor nature of the errors, the student should be awarded the higher end of the Level 2 marks.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B shows a attacking technique known as the creeping barrage. Source C is a account from a veteran who fought in spring offensive. These sources are useful for a historian. Source C talks about whippets a new tank. In 1916, when tanks were first used they struggled to break enemy lines. Within 2 years they were able to move quickly into enemy lines. I believe the usage of tanks in the spring offensive was a key reason germany specialised unit, storm troopers, even after artillery fire and mustard gas.

Source B is a propaganda news article showing a new attack the creeping barrage. It was used in Verdun to break the stalemate by providing covers for soldiers. It demonstrates how accurate artillery fire had become and how well timed the army had become. However due to it being British propaganda it hides the issues from the public. For example if any of the timing were of by even a second it could lead to men dieng by there own artillery this happened and hundreds died. Both sources are usefull but they hide the issues with new technology because of the government controll over media in war. ","The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides some contextual knowledge to support their analysis. For Source B, they mention the ""creeping barrage"" and its use in Verdun, explaining how it was intended to break the stalemate by providing cover for soldiers. They also acknowledge the source's nature as propaganda, which could hide the issues from the public, such as the dangers of mistimed artillery fire. This shows an understanding of the source's content and provenance, though the evaluation could be more developed.

For Source C, the student identifies it as an account from a veteran who fought in the Spring Offensive and mentions the use of ""Whippet"" tanks. They provide some contextual knowledge about the development of tanks from 1916 to 1918 and their role in countering German stormtroopers. However, the evaluation of the source's usefulness could be more explicit and detailed.

The student attempts to evaluate the relationship between the sources by discussing how both sources hide the issues with new technology due to government control over media during the war. This shows an understanding of the broader context and the limitations of the sources.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed and explicit evaluation of the content and provenance of both sources, as well as more specific factual knowledge to support their analysis. They should also make the focus on utility more explicit throughout the answer.

The first issue this caused was a war on two front west France, east Russia. This meant that Germany was spread thin on supply meaning the soldiers began to starve as they couldn't transport food to 2 fronts. For survival the Germans began to dig trenches so the British and the French did too.

This was the second issue the creation of trenches led to a stalemate. During this thousands of men died but no land was taken due to periods of heavy artillery fire. In addition the trenches condition caused issues as disease spread fast so hundreds died due to a lack of hygiene for example trench foot from the muddy floor and cholera was spread due to flees bitting the infected and spreading it.","The student begins by outlining the Schlieffen Plan and its intended purpose, which demonstrates a basic understanding of the plan. They correctly identify the failure of the plan due to Belgian resistance and the rapid mobilization of Russian forces, which moves the answer beyond Level 1.

The student then explains the first consequence of the plan's failure: a war on two fronts. This explanation includes the logistical difficulties faced by Germany, such as the strain on supplies and the need to dig trenches, which aligns with Level 2 criteria for showing a simple understanding of sequencing and supporting it with factual knowledge.

The second issue discussed is the creation of trenches leading to a stalemate. The student provides specific details about the conditions in the trenches, such as disease and trench foot, which demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. This further supports the answer being in Level 2.

To reach Level 3, the student would need to provide a more developed analysis of causation and consequence, with a structured and well-ordered narrative that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding.

For example, countries who didn’t intervene with Europe affairs like England began to worry and they began forming alliances with the entene cordial in 1904 with France and England and the triple extent in 1906 with France England and Russia. This ment if any country went to war they would all get dragged in.

The alliances also escalated the balkans crisis into major war as Austria Hungary had been given a blanc check by Germany as they had full suport. It also created tension between Russia (not wanting to look weak) and Germany. Due to Russias pride they refused to step down to Germany. France a russian aly began preparing for war due to Russides actions. Austria would use German engineering to bomb belgrade this was the first bombing of WW1. 

The Alliance caused conflict as other countries wanting to join for example Serbia and Bosnia turned to unite with Russia as they were Slavic Brothers. Bosnia had a revolution against Austria where Arche duke frans ferdinand was assasinated because they wanted to escape Austria's controll and join russia. This led to the to point ultimatum which would be the reason war broke out. Due to the alliance all the countries were dragged in even ones who did nothing in the Balkans crisis.

There would have been less conflict if alliances weren't made.
","The student begins by addressing the given factor, the Alliance System, and provides some relevant points. They mention the formation of alliances such as the Entente Cordiale and the Triple Entente, and how these alliances meant that if one country went to war, others would be dragged in. This shows some understanding of the alliance system and its impact on the escalation of the war.

In the second paragraph, the student discusses the Balkans crisis and the blank check given by Germany to Austria-Hungary, which escalated tensions. They also mention the involvement of Russia and France, showing some understanding of the broader implications of the alliance system. However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed factual knowledge.

The third paragraph touches on the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the subsequent ultimatum, which led to the outbreak of war. The student mentions the involvement of Serbia and Bosnia and their desire to unite with Russia, but the explanation is somewhat disjointed and lacks clarity.

Overall, the student demonstrates a basic understanding of the alliance system and its role in the escalation of the First World War.

For example, countries who didn’t intervene with Europe affairs like England began to worry and they began forming alliances with the entene cordial in 1904 with France and England and the triple extent in 1906 with France England and Russia. This ment if any country went to war they would all get dragged in.

The alliances also escalated the balkans crisis into major war as Austria Hungary had been given a blanc check by Germany as they had full suport. It also created tension between Russia (not wanting to look weak) and Germany. Due to Russias pride they refused to step down to Germany. France a russian aly began preparing for war due to Russides actions. Austria would use German engineering to bomb belgrade this was the first bombing of WW1. 

The Alliance caused conflict as other countries wanting to join for example Serbia and Bosnia turned to unite with Russia as they were Slavic Brothers. Bosnia had a revolution against Austria where Arche duke frans ferdinand was assasinated because they wanted to escape Austria's controll and join russia. This led to the to point ultimatum which would be the reason war broke out. Due to the alliance all the countries were dragged in even ones who did nothing in the Balkans crisis.

There would have been less conflict if alliances weren't made.

","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, I will assess the student's answer focusing on Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG).

### Analysis:

1. **Spelling:**
   - Correct: ""extent,"" ""intervene,"" ""forming,"" ""escalated,"" ""crisis,"" ""tension,"" ""pride,"" ""refused,"" ""preparing,"" ""engineering,"" ""bombing,"" ""conflict,"" ""revolution,"" ""ultimatum,"" ""reason,"" ""crisis.""
   - Incorrect: ""entene"" (should be ""Entente""), ""cordial"" (should be ""Cordiale""), ""extent"" (should be ""Entente""), ""ment"" (should be ""meant""), ""blanc"" (should be ""blank""), ""suport"" (should be ""support""), ""aly"" (should be ""ally""), ""Russides"" (should be ""Russia's""), ""Arche duke frans ferdinand"" (should be ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand""), ""assasinated"" (should be ""assassinated""), ""controll"" (should be ""control""), ""russia"" (should be ""Russia"").

2. **Punctuation:**
   - Correct: Use of commas and periods in most places.
   - Incorrect: Missing commas for clarity, inconsistent capitalization (e.g., ""entene cordial"" should be ""Entente Cordiale""), inconsistent use of capital letters for proper nouns (e.g., ""russia"" should be ""Russia""), missing apostrophes (e.g., ""Russides"" should be ""Russia's"").

3. **Grammar:**
   - Correct: The overall meaning is conveyed, and the sentences are generally understandable.
   - Incorrect: Some grammatical errors that affect clarity (e.g., ""countries who didn’t intervene with Europe affairs"" should be ""countries that didn’t intervene in European affairs""), awkward phrasing (e.g., ""This ment if any country went to war they would all get dragged in"" should be ""This meant that if any country went to war, they would all be dragged in""), and run-on sentences.

4. **Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses several specialist terms related to the topic (e.g., ""Entente Cordiale,"" ""Triple Entente,"" ""Balkans crisis,"" ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand,"" ""ultimatum"").

### Conclusion:
The student's answer demonstrates a reasonable level of spelling, punctuation, and grammar, with some errors that do not significantly hinder the overall meaning. The use of specialist terms is evident, though not always accurate.

### Marks Awarded:
Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the assessment, the student's answer fits best in **Level 3** due to reasonable accuracy in SPaG and the use of specialist terms, despite some errors.

Contextually we can infer that sential Communist Lenin was sent from Switzerland to Russia where he was exiled to stir up tensions on Russia so that the Germans could get some relief off the Eastern front. The style of clothing that the Russian Imperialist is wearing represents royalty which ties into the fact that Russia had its monarchy killed during the revolution to show its harsh and neglect that it gave to the Russian people centuries prior. Lenin was sent by Kaiser Wilhelm as he knew a time like this for Russia would be perfect as he was brought major famine and poverty to Russia, so he wanted change.
","The student identifies relevant features of the source, such as the depiction of the Bolshevik with ""German gold"" and the German Kaiser in the background. They also provide some contextual knowledge, mentioning Lenin's return to Russia and the impact of the Bolshevik Revolution. However, the analysis lacks clarity and focus on how these elements are critical of the Bolsheviks. The student does not explicitly explain how the source is critical of the Bolsheviks, which is necessary for a developed analysis.

To reach Level 2, the student would need to provide a clearer explanation of how the source is critical of the Bolsheviks, supported by more precise factual knowledge. For example, they could explain that the cartoon suggests the Bolsheviks betrayed Russia by making peace with Germany, which allowed Germany to concentrate its forces on the Western Front, thus betraying the Allies.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In Source B, the picture depicts a array of soldiers - most likely to be on the Allied forces - crossing over no man's land with shells firing over them at a constant rate. Contextually we know that during the Battle of the Somme in 1916 and the battle of Passchendaele. In 1917, the British forces were able to tactically redirected the way they used artillery by creating a creeping barrage where in a certain order a certain amount of shells could be fired upfront at the troops to clear any enemy ground/territory, which provided as a explosive shield which now able to give them easier access towards the trench for bayonett charging. This was vital to break the stalemate as a historian can gather the fact that the German forces were overwhelmed at the change in fire rate which  was able to will thousand more proving to be more effective. Due to the smoke after the

explosion, the Germans couldn't also see the advancing troops in front of them which caused major distress. Source C brings the idea of tanks into the question which was a revolutionary idea at the time as there was anything like it. In September 1916 the first battalion of tanks were deployed into the Battle of the Somme which allowed for the ease of movement to continue. Trenches had become ineffective for the Germany as they could have just been ran over. Barbed wire which was a massive problem until this point also became ineffective as tanks could have just flattened them causing no distress from when explosives blew them up which only led to them becoming noisy. The tanks had a 360 turret which was later developed which could shoot from anywhere. In the Battle of Cambrai, 1917 they were able to use the tanks for a circular formation in rows as the Battle of the Somme let only 50 tanks remaining from the 400 used. Towards the end of the war which was a vital asset for the allied victory as the Germans could really fight back.

","The student provides a detailed analysis of both sources, showing a good understanding of the content and context. They bring in relevant factual knowledge about the Battle of the Somme, Passchendaele, and the development of artillery tactics such as the creeping barrage. This demonstrates a clear understanding of how military technology and tactics evolved during the First World War.

For Source B, the student explains how the picture depicts soldiers advancing under an artillery barrage and links this to the historical context of the creeping barrage tactic. They highlight how this tactic was vital in breaking the stalemate on the Western Front and how it overwhelmed German forces. This shows a developed evaluation of the content of the source.

For Source C, the student discusses the introduction and impact of tanks, specifically the 'Whippets,' during the German Spring Offensive. They provide contextual knowledge about the first use of tanks in the Battle of the Somme and their subsequent development and deployment in battles such as Cambrai. This demonstrates a developed evaluation of the content of the source.

However, the student does not explicitly evaluate the provenance of the sources, which is necessary for a level 4 response. They mention that Source B is a picture published in a British newspaper and that Source C is adapted from a book by a tank commander, but they do not discuss how these aspects affect the utility of the sources.

To reach level 4, the student would need to include a more explicit evaluation of the provenance of both sources and how this affects their utility. For example, they could discuss how Source B, being published in a British newspaper, might have been intended to boost morale and support for the war effort, and how Source C, being written by a tank commander after the war, provides a first-hand account but might also be influenced by the author's personal experiences and perspective.

  example_answer: []",,"In the 19th Century just after the Franco-Prussian war which was a victory for Prussia, Alfred von Schlieffen created a plan which was fairly simple in a way to take out two of Europe’s biggest powers: France and Russia doing this by gathering a number of 750,000 troops, going through Alsace-Lorraine taking out France before diverting for Russia taking both out in the general scheme, however there was major flaws to this. Number one was that sometime before the war, France had created the Maginot line to protect himself from Germany if they were to ever attack again. This meant Germany had to divert for Belgium. However, in 1839 the Treaty of London was signed with Britain giving full support for Belgium as they gained independence from any country willing to attack them. This meant if Germany diverted for Belgium they would face a double threat with Britain joining the war. The Belgian army too would be employed adding resistance towards the Germans. On the Eastern side, Russia before the war was able to muster up men in the course of 4 weeks which wasn't apart of Germany plan as they assumed Russia would be the attack as a surprise. This led to a war on two fronts. The BEF also came in time to support the invasion before the Germans got to Paris.","The student provides a detailed account of the Schlieffen Plan and its intended strategy, which demonstrates a good understanding of the historical context. The answer includes specific factual knowledge, such as the involvement of Alfred von Schlieffen, the number of troops, and the diversion through Belgium due to the Maginot Line. The student also mentions the Treaty of London and the role of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which adds depth to the narrative.

However, the answer lacks a clear focus on the consequences of the Schlieffen Plan and how it led to problems in 1914. While the student identifies some issues, such as the involvement of Britain and the resistance from Belgium, the analysis of causation and consequence is not fully developed. The answer does not explicitly link these events to the broader problems that arose, such as the stalemate on the Western Front or the prolonged nature of the war.

To reach Level 3, the student would need to provide a more structured and well-ordered narrative that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding relevant to the question.

    - N/A",,"The alliance system in the first World War and the years building up to that was vital for the causes and the actual outcome of the war. I agree with this statement as there were many factors for this argument including: The Brothers alliance, Dual alliance which turned to the Triple alliance and the Entente Cordiale/Entente Alliance. In the late 19th century France and Russia as well as Austria-Hungary and Germany allied to protect themselves from each other in case of a war. The entente cordiale in 1904 was also another reason why tensions fired up with the old Entente and Germany due to the Moroccan crisis. These two events and their conferences started a clear divide in those countries listed as France wanted more colonies however this was disrupting the Kaiser's Weltpolitik which was his world view and the way he wanted to grow his empire doing this by trying to help at Morocco. In the Balkans the tension between the alliances of the Balkan League and the Ottoman empire stirred up causingfor two wars which left that are with nonstop raising tensions. Russia and Serbia had a brotherhood alliance as they were both Slavic. Bosnia another slavic county was going to get annexed by austria (which already had previous tensions with Russia). This angered the Serbains leading the Russians backing them up in justification of a war. The Germans however were not happy with this giving Austria a blank check allowing them for help whenever they need it also giving Russia a ultimatum to stop and back out of Autria-Hungary and Serbian tensions which they desired. 

Another alliance between the French and the Belgians also stopped and aggrovated German plans for WWI in attacking france Belgian led to Britain joining the war which would become a burden for the Kaiser. This caused a massive divide in the Nations of Europe which was a factor of the July crisis which ultimately ended up with the start of world war one. In conclusion we can see that the build up of allinnces between certain countries in Europe and Asia (Japanese and the British) led to a mess as various problems were split through various different nations. This includes Italy who was originally part of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria but however to unprecedented events switched to the Entente side by the start of the war.

","The student provides a detailed explanation of the alliance system and its role in causing the First World War. They mention several key alliances, such as the Dual Alliance, Triple Alliance, and Entente Cordiale, and explain how these alliances created tensions and divisions among European powers. The student also discusses specific events, such as the Moroccan Crisis and the Balkan Wars, which further heightened tensions.

The first paragraph demonstrates a range of accurate and detailed knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The student explains the alliances and their impact on international relations, showing a developed line of reasoning. However, the explanation could be more coherent and structured to improve clarity.

The second paragraph continues to explain the impact of alliances, particularly focusing on the French-Belgian alliance and its effect on German plans. The student also mentions the July Crisis and the role of alliances in escalating the situation to a full-scale war. This paragraph demonstrates a developed explanation with accurate knowledge and understanding.

The conclusion attempts to summarize the argument, stating that the build-up of alliances led to a complex web of tensions and conflicts. However, the conclusion could be more explicit in making a sustained judgement about the extent to which the alliance system was the main cause of the war.

Overall, the answer falls into Level 3. The student provides a developed explanation of the stated factor (the alliance system) and other factors, demonstrating accurate knowledge and understanding. The line of reasoning is coherent and logical, but the answer could be improved with a more structured and explicit conclusion.

","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, I will assess the student's answer focusing on Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG).

### Analysis:

1. **Spelling:**
   - The student has several spelling errors: ""causingfor"" (should be ""causing for""), ""aggrovated"" (should be ""aggravated""), ""allinnces"" (should be ""alliances""), ""Autria"" (should be ""Austria""), ""Serbains"" (should be ""Serbians""), ""ultimatum"" (should be ""ultimatum""), ""led"" (should be ""lead""), ""Bosnia another slavic county"" (should be ""country""), ""nonstop raising tensions"" (should be ""non-stop rising tensions"").
   - Despite these errors, the majority of the text is spelled correctly.

2. **Punctuation:**
   - There are several punctuation issues: missing commas, incorrect use of commas, and run-on sentences. For example:
     - ""The alliance system in the first World War and the years building up to that was vital for the causes and the actual outcome of the war."" (This sentence could be clearer with better punctuation.)
     - ""This angered the Serbains leading the Russians backing them up in justification of a war."" (This sentence is confusing and could use better punctuation for clarity.)
     - ""Another alliance between the French and the Belgians also stopped and aggrovated German plans for WWI in attacking france Belgian led to Britain joining the war which would become a burden for the Kaiser."" (This sentence is a run-on and needs punctuation for clarity.)

3. **Grammar:**
   - The student demonstrates a general control of grammar, but there are several grammatical errors:
     - ""The alliance system in the first World War and the years building up to that was vital for the causes and the actual outcome of the war."" (The subject-verb agreement is off; it should be ""were vital."")
     - ""This angered the Serbains leading the Russians backing them up in justification of a war."" (This sentence is awkward and unclear.)
     - ""Another alliance between the French and the Belgians also stopped and aggrovated German plans for WWI in attacking france Belgian led to Britain joining the war which would become a burden for the Kaiser."" (This sentence is confusing and grammatically incorrect.)

4. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as ""Triple Alliance,"" ""Entente Cordiale,"" ""Weltpolitik,"" ""Balkan League,"" ""Ottoman Empire,"" ""blank check,"" and ""ultimatum.""

### Conclusion:
The student's answer demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, though there are several errors. The grammar shows general control of meaning, but some sentences are awkward and unclear. The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately.

Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer fits best in **Level 2**.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B and C are very useful to an historian studying military technologey and tactics in the First World War because source B shows how the tactic rolling barrage worked. It was a slow-paced artillery attack which consisted of a line of artillery far back out of sight and then tanks and soldiers. This tactic became very efficient when radios were developed as the front line could talk to the artillery and tell them where to fire.

Source C is also very important as a historian as it shows how the development of tanks changed the course of the war. Tanks were firsted used in the battle of somme yet they werent as effective until later on in the war. Infact tanks were so effective that they completely stopped stalemate all together. Britain were also so good at making tanks that when a tank broke down the Germans would capture it and fix it so that they could use it instead. ","The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the content of both sources and provides some contextual knowledge. For Source B, the student explains the concept of a ""rolling barrage"" and mentions the development of radios, which is relevant to the source. However, the explanation lacks depth and does not fully evaluate the source's utility.

For Source C, the student discusses the development and effectiveness of tanks, mentioning their first use at the Battle of the Somme and their role in breaking the stalemate. The student also notes that the Germans would capture and use British tanks. While this shows some understanding, the evaluation is not fully developed and lacks specific details about the source's content and provenance.

To reach a higher level, the student needs to provide more detailed evaluation of both the content and provenance of the sources. For example, they could discuss the significance of Source B being published in a British newspaper in 1917 and how it might reflect public perception or propaganda. For Source C, they could evaluate the reliability of the account given that it was written by a tank commander who participated in the battle and was awarded a medal for bravery.

    - N/A",,"I do agree that the alliance system was a main cause of the first world war as Britain would have never been dragged into the war because of it's alliance with Belgium which stated Britain had to support Belgium if they were ever invaded and Germany invaded Belgium to get to France. However I believe another very important cause to world war one was the war at sea as Britain are very patriotic about there Navy once they saw Germany building up there Navy Britain had to make theres larger because of the two power standard this lead to a Naval race which end with war at sea. This war did not get well for the Germans as The British's naval blockade of German ports was so good that 420,000 German troops died of starvation as not enough food was getting through. It also meant that Germany didn't have enough resource to carry on in this Industrial war.

Yet another key cause of the war was the Moroccan crisis as in 1906 France wanted to own Morocco which everyone was fine with except from Germany who was openly expressing that Morocco should be an indepent country yet France didnt care about what Germany had to say and expanded Morocco into there empire and gave Germany a small part of Africa to compensate them this didnt sit well with the kaiser as he felt humiliated and tention grew between France and Germany. Later on in 1911 a rebellion happen in Morocco so the king of Morocco asked France for help and so France deployed 20,000 troops in Morocco, Germany got news of this and though France were trying to invade Morocco so the Kaiser decided to deploy battleship all around Morocco as people realised what the Kaiser wanted after this incident other nations started preparing for war.

So my conclusion is that although the alliance system was an important factor to the build up of the war it wasnt the main factor and it was in fact a mix of all these things put together.  ","The student begins by addressing the stated factor, the alliance system, and provides a basic explanation of how it contributed to the outbreak of the First World War. They mention Britain's alliance with Belgium and Germany's invasion of Belgium, which brought Britain into the war. This shows some specific knowledge and understanding, but the explanation is relatively simple and lacks depth.

The student then moves on to discuss the naval race between Britain and Germany, providing specific details about the naval blockade and its impact on Germany. This explanation is more developed and shows a good range of factual knowledge, but it is not directly linked to the question of the main cause of the war.

The third paragraph discusses the Moroccan Crisis, providing specific details about the events and their impact on tensions between France and Germany. This explanation is also developed and shows a good range of factual knowledge, but again, it is not directly linked to the question of the main cause of the war.

The conclusion attempts to make a judgement, stating that the alliance system was an important factor but not the main factor, and that a mix of factors contributed to the war. However, the conclusion is not well-substantiated and does not provide a complex, sustained line of reasoning.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding, but the explanations are not consistently developed, and the answer lacks a coherent, logical structure. The student does not fully address the relationship between the different causes or provide a sustained judgement.

Overall, the answer falls into level 2 and should be awarded 7 marks.",7,7,16,2,2,TRUE,1,0,,,,,6.841809034,"{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 21964, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.10982, 'completion_tokens': 307, 'completion_cost': 0.004605, 'total_cost': 0.114425}","{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 345, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.001725, 'completion_tokens': 1, 'completion_cost': 1.5e-05, 'total_cost': 0.00174}"

So my conclusion is that although the alliance system was an important factor to the build up of the war it wasnt the main factor and it was in fact a mix of all these things put together.  ","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, here is the analysis of the student's answer:

### Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG) Analysis:

1. **Spelling:**
   - There are several spelling errors: ""it's"" should be ""its,"" ""there"" should be ""their,"" ""theres"" should be ""theirs,"" ""indepent"" should be ""independent,"" ""tention"" should be ""tension,"" ""didnt"" should be ""didn't,"" ""though"" should be ""thought,"" and ""happen"" should be ""happened.""
   - However, many words are spelled correctly, and the errors do not severely hinder understanding.

2. **Punctuation:**
   - There are multiple punctuation errors: missing commas, incorrect use of apostrophes, and lack of periods in some places.
   - For example, ""Britain would have never been dragged into the war because of it's alliance with Belgium"" should be ""Britain would have never been dragged into the war because of its alliance with Belgium.""
   - The sentence structure is often run-on, lacking proper punctuation to separate ideas.

3. **Grammar:**
   - The grammar is generally understandable but has several issues: ""Britain are very patriotic"" should be ""Britain is very patriotic,"" ""this lead to a Naval race"" should be ""this led to a Naval race,"" and ""this war did not get well for the Germans"" should be ""this war did not go well for the Germans.""
   - Despite these errors, the overall meaning is generally clear.

4. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses several specialist terms appropriately: ""alliance system,"" ""Naval race,"" ""two power standard,"" ""naval blockade,"" ""Moroccan crisis,"" ""Kaiser,"" and ""rebellion.""
   - The range of specialist terms is good, though not exceptionally wide.

### Level Assessment:

- **Level 1 Criteria:**
  - The student does not meet the criteria for consistent accuracy in spelling and punctuation.
  - The control of grammar is not effective enough to meet the high performance standard.
  - The range of specialist terms is good but not wide.

- **Level 2 Criteria:**
  - The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy, though there are notable errors.
  - The control of grammar is general but not precise.
  - The range of specialist terms is good.

- **Level 3 Criteria:**
  - The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy.
  - The control of grammar is sufficient to convey meaning, though errors are present.
  - The range of specialist terms is limited but appropriate.

Given the forgiving nature of the grading and the overall performance, the student demonstrates a good range of specialist terms and a general control of meaning despite the errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar.

### Final Marks Awarded:

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by

Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,

Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In source B, the image shows British soldiers advancing under a artillery barrage and it shows the soldiers moving forwards behind every artillery bomb, this is a great tactic because bombs that drop make it uneasy to see the soldiers as there is smoke everywhere and the lines represent the artillery bombs falling down.

Furthermore, source C was a tank commander, who was stuck and German soldiers were ready to attack the tank but when the commander looked to his right, he saw seven of the newest and fastest tanks, 'Whippets', spring into action. This goes to show that military weapons are useful and helpful during the war.  ","The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides a basic analysis of their content. For Source B, the student describes the image and explains the tactic of advancing under an artillery barrage. For Source C, the student recounts the tank commander's experience and highlights the effectiveness of the new 'Whippet' tanks. However, the analysis lacks depth and does not include much contextual knowledge or evaluation of the provenance of the sources.

To improve, the student should provide more detailed contextual knowledge about the tactics and technology used during the First World War and evaluate the reliability and usefulness of the sources based on their provenance. For example, they could discuss how Source B, being a newspaper image, might have been intended to boost public morale and support for the war effort, and how Source C, being a first-hand account from a tank commander, provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of tanks in battle.

Germany wanted to invade France and defeat them quickly within six weeks and then defeat Russia because the Germans thought that they weren't prepared and were weak. But this didn't go well because the Russians were fully prepared and strong to fight back which caused Germany to wait longer and Germany had to go through Belgium and claim it, then do a surprise attack on France by going round the French troops and surrounding them.

","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's assess the student's answer for Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG):

### Analysis:

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are some issues with capitalization (e.g., ""ww1"" should be ""WW1"").
   - Punctuation is inconsistent. For example, there are missing commas and periods that make the answer harder to read. The sentence ""I mainly agree with this statement because the alliance between Britain and Belgium also caused ww1 because after Germany invaded Belgium Britain stepped and that caused another major problem to Germans Schlieffen plan and there were already alliances that built up tension before the war, such as the entente cordial, which include, Britain, France and Russia and the triple alliance, which included Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy."" is a run-on sentence and could be broken down for clarity.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are some issues that affect the overall control of meaning. For example, ""Britain stepped and that caused another major problem to Germans Schlieffen plan"" is unclear and should be rephrased for better understanding.
   - The use of ""entente cordial"" should be ""Entente Cordiale,"" and ""triple alliance"" should be ""Triple Alliance.""

3. **Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as ""Schlieffen plan,"" ""entente cordial,"" ""triple alliance,"" and ""Weltpolitik."" However, some terms are not capitalized correctly, which affects the overall presentation.

### Conclusion:

Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme:

- **Level 1** requires consistent accuracy in spelling and punctuation, effective control of grammar, and a wide range of specialist terms. The student's answer does not meet this level due to inconsistent punctuation and some grammatical errors.
- **Level 2** requires considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, general control of grammar, and a good range of specialist terms. The student's answer fits this level better, as it shows considerable accuracy in spelling and a good range of specialist terms, despite some punctuation and grammatical issues.
- **Level 3** requires reasonable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, some control of grammar, and a limited range of specialist terms. The student's answer exceeds this level due to the use of a good range of specialist terms and more than reasonable accuracy in spelling and punctuation.

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The answer does not clearly identify a specific way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate. The statement ""The internet may affect where a business chooses to locate as it could help them see if there are any gaps in the market through social media"" is vague and does not directly address the location aspect. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The explanation provided is not directly related to the location decision. The candidate mentions that the business ""may locate near to these customers to attract more,"" but this is not sufficiently developed or linked to the use of the internet. The explanation lacks clarity and depth. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is: 
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per unit} - \text{Variable Costs per unit}}
     \]
   - The Answer correctly substitutes the values into the formula:

     10000 / (6.5 - 2.5) = 2500
     \]
   - This step is correct and matches the Mark Scheme.

2. **Calculation of decrease in break-even level of output:**
   - The Answer correctly calculates the new break-even level of output as 2500 units.
   - However, the Answer does not explicitly state the decrease in the break-even level of output.
   - According to the Mark Scheme, the decrease should be calculated as:
     \[

     \]
   - The Answer does not include this final step.

**Marking:**
- For the correct substitution into the formula and calculation of the new break-even level of output, the Answer earns 1 mark.
- The Answer does not explicitly state the decrease in the break-even level of output, so it does not earn the second mark.

  - The answer identifies a way a small business could become more competitive by stating, ""A small business could become more competitive by having a Unique Selling Point."" This satisfies the first marking criterion. (1 mark)

- **Explanation of the way:**
  - The explanation begins with ""This will make their product stand out,"" which indicates how having a Unique Selling Point (USP) can differentiate the product from others in the market. This aligns with the example answer where improving the quality of the product makes it stand out.
  - The answer further explains, ""and attract customers which will increase their sales and market share.""

  - The internet will not provide focused information to let Amelia know if there will be enough demand for her plumbing and building services (AO2).
  - Although she knows how many females live in Birmingham, it would be difficult to find out how many of them own a property or would want a female plumber to work in their homes (AO3a).
  - Lili Heating Ltd will be in competition against other established plumbers. Amelia will need to spend more time developing her target market to make sure there are enough potential customers (AO3a).

    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.

Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","Lili Heating Ltd should choose option 1. This is the better option compared to option 2 as she is already trying to promote her business through customers so using social media would be a waste of time. Choosing option 1 will help keep loyalty within female customers. This is because they do not have to pay as much which attract them even more. Having more loyalty will increase sales as more customers are attracted. Another positive of option 1 is that it may attract even more new customers. This is because discounting female customers betters her unique selling point making her business stand out to competitors. This will attract more customers which will increase sales and revenue to invest. Another positive is that she may gain promotion from option 1 anyway. This is because if any customers are satisfied with the service and price they may be more likely to recommend her business to others. This will increase her customer base and market share.
","The candidate begins by stating that Lili Heating Ltd should choose option 1, which is a clear stance. They provide some application of business concepts (AO2) by discussing customer loyalty and the unique selling point (USP) of offering discounts to female customers. This shows a sound understanding of the business context, although there are some inconsistencies, such as the assumption that using social media would be a waste of time.

The candidate deconstructs the business information and issues, finding interconnected points with chains of reasoning (AO3a). They discuss how offering discounts could increase customer loyalty, attract new customers, and lead to recommendations, which are logical points. However, the reasoning is somewhat repetitive and lacks depth, indicating a sound but not detailed analysis.

The candidate makes a judgement and provides a justification based on the evaluation of business information and issues relevant to the choice made (AO3b). They conclude that option 1 will increase sales and customer loyalty, which is a justified judgement. However, the evaluation is not thorough, and the justification is somewhat limited.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","There is a lack of security as if there is no wind they won't receive any energy or anything else from Ripple or the turbine.
","### Marking Criteria Analysis

#### Criteria: Stating one risk for investors in Ripple

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - **Evaluation:** The answer states, ""There is a lack of security as if there is no wind they won't receive any energy or anything else from Ripple or the turbine.""
   - **Justification:** This statement identifies a risk related to the dependency on wind for energy production. If there is no wind, the investors may not receive the energy they need, which is a valid risk for an investor in a wind farm. This aligns with the example answer ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs (1)"" from the mark scheme.

### Conclusion

The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple by highlighting the dependency on wind for energy production. This risk is directly related to the context of Ripple being a wind farm and the potential variability in wind availability.

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).
","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","The Government should choose option 2 for Ripple. This is because they have plans to create 220,000 new jobs. Paying for training will significantly reduce Ripple's costs and overheads. This will benefit Ripple as it will allow them to invest, expand and grow the business. Another benefit of this is that it may make the quality of Ripple better. This is because the workers have proper training which may attract more customers as the workers are providing better work. Another positive of this is that it may motivate the workers to work harder. This is because they feel valued as they have been given proper training and have been set a high standard to work at. This may maximize output and efficiency for Ripple which will help them grow as they won't be losing as much.
","The candidate begins by stating that the government should choose option 2 for Ripple, which is a clear stance. They provide a rationale for this choice by discussing the government's plan to create 220,000 new jobs and how paying for training will reduce Ripple's costs and overheads. This demonstrates some application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the context of Ripple (AO2).

The candidate then elaborates on the benefits of this option, such as allowing Ripple to invest, expand, and grow the business. They also mention that proper training may improve the quality of Ripple's services, attract more customers, and motivate workers, which could maximize output and efficiency. These points show interconnected reasoning, although there are some logical inconsistencies and a lack of detailed development (AO3a).

The final part of the answer provides a simple judgement based on the evaluation of the benefits of training, but it lacks a thorough evaluation of the business information and issues relevant to the choice made (AO3b).

Overall, the answer demonstrates sound application of knowledge and understanding with some interconnected points and a basic evaluation. Therefore, it fits best within Level 2.

This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","The importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix is significant as it helps them to compete. This is because they question customers to find out how much energy they use. This helps Ripple create a price for the customer to invest and helps to reduce how much the customers pay. This helps to match and offer lower prices to competitors. This may attract customers as price is a customer need. Another reason why price is important is that it helps to determine how much energy a customer gets. This is important as it will increase the reliability and quality of their service and product as it lets them know that they are getting value for their money. This may keep customers more loyal and increase Ripple's sales. However, price may not be as important in Ripple's marketing mix. Place is also an important part. This is because Ripple needs to locate its turbines to the areas with the most wind. This will help increase the productivity of the turbines which will help improve the efficiency. This will give the customers a lower price which may attract them even more. Where they are located is also important as it may require them to pay more to transport energy to customers, raising their prices. This may prevent customers from using Ripple as they may not get the energy as fast and may have to pay a higher price for the energy compared to competitors.Another important factor of Ripples marketing mix is its promotion. This is because they have to promote how environmentally friendly this energy is compared to others. This will help attract more customers and target those who wish to be more environmentally friendly. This will help to increase their sales as more people are aware of how environmentally friendly they are.
","The candidate begins by discussing the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix, noting that it helps Ripple compete by offering lower prices based on customer energy usage. This demonstrates an understanding of the role of price in attracting customers (AO1b). The candidate also mentions that price helps determine the amount of energy a customer receives, which can enhance customer loyalty and sales, showing some application to the business context (AO2).

In the second paragraph, the candidate introduces the importance of place, explaining that the location of turbines affects productivity and efficiency, which in turn impacts pricing and customer attraction. This shows an attempt to deconstruct business information and find interconnected points (AO3a). However, the explanation lacks depth and logical consistency, as it does not fully explore the implications of place on Ripple's overall strategy.

The candidate then discusses promotion, highlighting the need to promote Ripple's environmentally friendly energy to attract customers. This demonstrates an understanding of another element of the marketing mix and its relevance to Ripple's business (AO1b). However, the evaluation is somewhat superficial and does not provide a thorough analysis of how promotion interacts with price and place in Ripple's marketing strategy (AO3b).

Overall, the response demonstrates mostly accurate knowledge and understanding of business concepts, with appropriate use of business terminology in places. The application of knowledge to the business context is sound but contains some inconsistencies. The deconstruction of business information shows interconnected points, but there are logical inconsistencies, and the evaluation is not thorough.

Based on the mark scheme, the response fits best in Level 2. The candidate demonstrates mostly accurate knowledge and understanding, with sound application to the business context and some interconnected points with chains of reasoning. However, the evaluation lacks depth and thoroughness.

For Source C, the student highlights that it is a first-hand account from a tank commander, demonstrating the power and speed of tanks in the war.

However, the evaluation is quite simplistic and lacks depth. The student does not bring in much contextual knowledge or evaluate the provenance of the sources in a developed way. For example, they could have discussed how the publication date of Source B (October 1917) might reflect the evolving tactics and technology as the war progressed. Similarly, for Source C, they could have elaborated on the significance of the German Spring Offensive and how the introduction of 'Whippet' tanks represented a technological advancement.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed factual knowledge and a more thorough evaluation of the provenance and content of both sources. They should also consider the relationship between the sources and how they together provide a more comprehensive understanding of military technology and tactics in the First World War.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan led to problems in 1914 because it caused Britain to join the war. This is because a German general called Erik Von Schlieffen had come up with a plan to go to war with France. However they knew that they couldn't attack France head on since they had many troops there. This meant that they had to invade France from a different angle. Germany had decided to invade France by going through Belgium from above France and working there way down to Paris. The plan was estimated to take about 6 weeks before they could beat France and return back to Germany before Russia attacked. However, Britain had signed a treaty with Belgium to protect them at any cost. So when Belgium was invaded by Germany, Britain had to do something so they ended up joining the war against Germany. This was a big problem for Germany because the now had to fight against 3 major countries from 2 different angles.","The student provides a structured account of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, demonstrating specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The answer identifies the key elements of the plan, such as the invasion of Belgium and the intended quick defeat of France, and explains how this led to Britain joining the war due to its treaty with Belgium. This shows a simple analysis of causation/consequence, placing the answer in Level 2.

To reach Level 3, the student would need to develop the analysis further by explaining the broader consequences of the Schlieffen Plan's failure, such as the resulting stalemate and trench warfare on the Western Front. Additionally, more detailed factual knowledge and understanding, such as the impact of the Battle of the Marne or the quick mobilization of Russian forces, would be necessary.

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The answer contains a mix of correct and incorrect punctuation. For example, ""this is because"" should start with a capital letter, and there is a missing period at the end of the sentence.
   - Spelling appears to be accurate.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The grammar shows some control of meaning, but the sentence is incomplete and lacks clarity. The phrase ""once Britain had"" is left unfinished, which affects the overall meaning.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The answer uses some specialist terms such as ""triple alliance"" and ""triple entente,"" but the range is limited.

Given these observations, the answer does not meet the criteria for Level 1 or Level 2 due to the incomplete sentence and lack of consistent accuracy in punctuation. However, it does meet the criteria for Level 3 as it shows reasonable accuracy in spelling and some control of meaning, with errors that do not significantly hinder the overall meaning.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In Source B there is a creeping barrage being shown. In this movement, artillery would be sent over the top into no man's land and blow up just in front of the soldiers. While doing this, a huge smoke cloud would be created so soldiers could advance. The soldiers also would've used the Lewis gun which was a lighter machine gun seen as the first assault rifle. Secondly, planes could be used during the creeping barrage to further distract the enemy and make it easier for the soldiers. While doing this advancement, few men were killed by the explosion but it was a faster way of reaching the enemy trench line where the bayonets could be used too. In source C it talks about the use of tanks during WWI. Tanks could be used to squash barbed wire which would be lined across no mans land and also on enemy trenches. Doing this would create a ‘path’ for soldiers to follow without the risk of the barbed wire. Tanks were also used for that fear factor as they were new and fast with a machine gun which would scare enemies. ","The student identifies relevant features of both sources and explains their significance, showing understanding of the content. For Source B, the student describes the creeping barrage tactic and mentions the use of the Lewis gun and planes, providing some contextual knowledge. For Source C, the student explains the role of tanks in WWI, including their ability to clear barbed wire and their psychological impact on the enemy.

However, the evaluation of the sources' utility is not fully developed. The student does not explicitly link the content and provenance of the sources to their usefulness for a historian studying military technology and tactics in WWI. There is also no mention of the provenance of Source B, such as its publication date or the fact that it was published in a British newspaper, which could provide insight into public perception and propaganda during the war. Similarly, the provenance of Source C, including the author's background as a tank commander and the publication date, is not evaluated.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide a more complex evaluation of both sources, considering both content and provenance, and explicitly linking these to their utility for a historian. They should also evaluate the relationship between the sources, such as how they together illustrate the evolution of military tactics and technology during the war.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan led to problems in 1914 because Germany wanted to invade France who was a part of the triple entente. In doing this, Germany attracted Britain and Russia's attention. The Schlieffen plan's idea was to invade France through Belgium but to stop this, Britain 'set up' the Battle of the Marne and Somme to attempt to slow down the Germans. As a result this caused a stalemate with neither side moving and the eventual failure of the Schlieffen plan.

The triple entente consisting of France, Britain and Russia, and the Triple alliance with Germany, Italy and Austria-Hungary. As a result of this if one country from each side got dragged into war they would have to defend their fellow country. This is part of the cause for the first world war.

Another reason was the murder of Franz Ferdinand who was murdered in Serbia by a group called the black hand. This caused huge conflict between Germany and Serbia but Serbia was part of the Balkans which consisted of Serbia, Slovakia and other countrys around that area of europe. 

The final reason for the cause of the first world war was Germany were hungry for power and this was shown clearly by Kaiser Wilhelm Welt Politik policy. Kaiser Wilhelm believed that Germany should rule the whole of Europe. Other country needed to stop this from happening so when Germany invaded France he invaded the triple entente. 

In conclusion I somewhat agree that alliances were the main cause of world war one as they wasnt the reason for the murder of Franz Ferdinand or Germany wanting power over other nations.","The student begins by addressing the stated factor, the Alliance System, and provides a basic explanation of how alliances could lead to a larger conflict. They mention the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance, but the explanation lacks depth and specific factual knowledge. This places the answer in Level 1 initially.

In the second paragraph, the student introduces another factor, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. They provide some context but do not fully explain how this event led to the broader conflict, nor do they connect it back to the Alliance System effectively. This remains a basic explanation.

The third paragraph introduces a third factor, Germany's ambitions under Kaiser Wilhelm and the Weltpolitik policy. The student mentions Germany's desire for power and its invasion of France but does not provide detailed factual knowledge or a developed explanation of how this contributed to the war.

The conclusion attempts to make a judgement but is repetitive and does not add new insights or a complex evaluation of the factors discussed. The student acknowledges that alliances were not the sole cause but does not provide a sustained line of reasoning to support this.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B shows how British infantry advanced under the tactic called creeping barrage. In the source it shows British infantry advancing across no man's land while allied artillery shells were shot and exploded not too far in front of them while planes most likely allie planes were flying above communicating with the infantry and artillery to make sure they can surprise the Germans without mass casualties. This source can tell a historian how the creeping barrage was used and how it worked. The source can tell a historian that artillery was shot at a certain angle, so it would land and explode not to go away from the infantry, so they have some sort of cover during a while they walked across no man's land. The historian can also interpret that the planes observing this are most likely coordinating the attack from above telling the artillery when and where to fire and telling the infantry when and how far they should move. 

Source C shows a piece of a book written by a soldier that fought against the Germans during World War One. The source can tell a historian about how useful  the development of tanks during world war one. The source describes how a allied soldier was about to be attacked by german soldiers while stuck in a tank. This could tell a historian that tanks originally were always getting stuck and weren't that helpful at first but then the source describes how the allies were making fast and most likely more powerful tanks as the war went on. The source describes whippets as faster and newer than the one that the writer was using yet again giving back to how the allies we contantly upgrading these tanks. The source then describes how the wippets while giving their machine guns drove straight into the german soldiers and this caused them to scatter. This can tell a historian that first this was a time where tanks only had machine guns and not an artillery cannon welded onto of them and two the fact that these tanks could eliminate a german trench with ease. Source C really highlights how important tanks were to during the first world war.

While source b shows the importance of tanks during the first world war with three example being the creaping barrage and Source C shows the the importance of technology and how important tanks were. In conclusion both Source B and C would show a historian how useful technology and tanks involved as the war continued and how the advancement and development of both was important to the allies winning the war.","The student demonstrates a clear understanding of both sources and provides a detailed analysis of their content. For Source B, the student explains the concept of the creeping barrage and how it was used to protect advancing infantry. They also mention the role of planes in coordinating the attack, showing a good grasp of the tactics and technology used during the First World War. This analysis is supported by contextual knowledge, making it a strong evaluation of the source's content.

For Source C, the student describes the development and effectiveness of tanks, particularly the newer 'Whippet' tanks. They highlight how these tanks were faster and more powerful, and how they played a crucial role in breaking through German lines. The student also notes the limitations of earlier tanks, providing a balanced view of the technology's evolution. This analysis is again supported by contextual knowledge, making it a thorough evaluation of the source's content.

The student attempts to evaluate the provenance of both sources, noting that Source B is a picture published in a British newspaper and Source C is an excerpt from a book written by a tank commander. However, the evaluation of provenance is not as developed as the content analysis. The student could improve by discussing the potential biases and reliability of these sources, such as the purpose of the newspaper picture to boost morale or the personal perspective of the tank commander.

The conclusion attempts to link both sources together, stating that they show the importance of technology and tactics in the First World War.

  example_answer: []",,The Schlieffen Plan was a plan made by a top German general before the start of WW1. The Schlieffen Plan was a tactic that would make it so that Germany wouldn't have to fight a war on two fronts in the west against France and the in the east against Russia. The plan was the idea that the Germans would knock France out of the war in 6 weeks by capturing Paris. The Germans then thought that it would take 6 weeks for Russia to mobilize its army to the eastern front. Within those 6 weeks the German army would knock France out of the war then transport its entire army to the eastern front. This of course did not happen. The Schlieffen Plan was doomed to fail. It counted on luck and luck only.,"The student provides a basic overview of the Schlieffen Plan, explaining its purpose and the intended sequence of events. This moves the answer beyond level 0, as it addresses the question and demonstrates some knowledge of the plan. However, the answer lacks detailed analysis of how the Schlieffen Plan led to problems in 1914. 

To reach level 2, the student would need to provide a structured account that demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. For example, they could explain how the German advance through Belgium was slowed down by fighting Belgian and British troops, or how the French were able to push back the German front line, leading to the need for both sides to build trenches.

To reach level 3, the student would need to develop their analysis further, showing how the failure of the Schlieffen Plan led to a stalemate on the Western Front. They could discuss the impact of the Battle of the Marne and how both sides dug a line of trenches that stretched across France.

    - N/A",,"The alliance system describes how both the triple entente and the central powers were formed. The triple entente consisted of Britian, France and Russia while the central powers consisted of Germany, Austria - Hungary and Italy. All countries in both alliances promised one thing, to defend each other against an attacking country. 

I do agree that the alliance system was a cause but not the main one. I do believe it is a cause because after the alliances were made tension in Europe increased due to all the big powers in Europe being in an alliance that meant if one country from one alliance attacked then a country from the other alliance it meant meant a full war in europe. The alliance also caused problems in other continents due to Germany wanting an empire of its own but couldn't because Britain and France had colonies there meaning Germany taking land near British and French colonies could cause a war between the 2 alliances.

 However the alliance system wasn't the only big reason why WW1 started. Another reason would be the fact that Germany wanted a navy that could rival Great Britain, which the British didn't want to happen due to their policy of a 2 power standard or that they must have the strongest navy. This lead to an arm race between Britain and Germany to see who could make the most and better weapons than the other. This caused tension to rise between both Britain and germany which didn't help with the fact that Germany had colonys near or not to British ones.

In conclusion although the alliance system was a big reason of why WW1 started I do believe that it is the main reason. Especially combined with the fact that Germany wanted more power in the first place and the creation of the Schlieffen plan even without the alliance system WW1 would of happened anyway. All it did was speed it up.
","The student begins by explaining the alliance system, identifying the Triple Entente and the Central Powers and their mutual defense agreements. This demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding of the stated factor.

In the second paragraph, the student provides a simple explanation of how the alliance system increased tension in Europe, mentioning the potential for a full-scale war if one country attacked another. They also touch on the impact of Germany's imperial ambitions on tensions with Britain and France. This explanation is coherent and structured, but it lacks depth and detailed factual knowledge, keeping it within Level 2.

The third paragraph introduces another factor: the naval arms race between Germany and Britain. The student explains how Germany's desire for a powerful navy led to increased tension with Britain, which adhered to the two-power standard. This explanation is relevant and shows specific knowledge, but it remains a simple explanation without developed reasoning, keeping it within Level 2.

The conclusion attempts to make a judgement, stating that the alliance system was a significant reason for the war but not the main one. The student argues that Germany's ambitions and the Schlieffen Plan would have led to war regardless of the alliance system. However, this judgement is not fully substantiated with detailed reasoning or evidence, preventing it from reaching Level 3.

Overall, the answer demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding of the alliance system and other factors, with simple, coherent explanations. However, it lacks the developed reasoning and detailed factual knowledge required for higher levels.

","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, here is the analysis of the student's answer:

### Spelling:
- The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors:
  - ""Britian"" should be ""Britain""
  - ""Austria - Hungary"" should be ""Austria-Hungary"" (no space around the hyphen)
  - ""meant meant"" is a repetition error
  - ""europe"" should be ""Europe"" (capitalization)
  - ""lead"" should be ""led"" (past tense)
  - ""germany"" should be ""Germany"" (capitalization)
  - ""colonys"" should be ""colonies""
  - ""would of"" should be ""would have""

### Punctuation:
- The student uses punctuation reasonably well, but there are some issues:
  - ""Austria - Hungary"" should be ""Austria-Hungary"" (no space around the hyphen)
  - ""2 power standard"" should be ""two-power standard"" (hyphenation and spelling out the number)
  - ""arm race"" should be ""arms race""
  - ""colonys near or not to British ones"" is unclear and could be better punctuated for clarity.

### Grammar:
- The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are some errors:
  - ""it meant meant a full war in europe"" should be ""it meant a full war in Europe""
  - ""Germany had colonys near or not to British ones"" is unclear and grammatically incorrect.
  - ""WW1 would of happened"" should be ""WW1 would have happened""

### Specialist Terms:
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as ""triple entente,"" ""central powers,"" ""Schlieffen plan,"" and ""two-power standard.""

### Overall Control of Meaning:
- The student generally maintains control of meaning, but some sentences are awkward or unclear, which slightly hinders the overall clarity.

### Final Analysis:
- The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy but has several errors.
- The student uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, but errors do not significantly hinder meaning overall.
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms.

Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's performance aligns most closely with **Level 2**. The errors present prevent it from reaching Level 1, but the overall control of meaning and use of specialist terms are strong enough to place it above Level 3.

We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B is from a British newspaper published in October 1917 showing how a creeping barrage works. A creeping barrage is where artillery would fire shells just in front of the soldiers which are slowly moving forward. The aim was to leave no enemies behind. The creeping barrage is one of the main reasons which led to Britain winning WWI.
Source C is from a book about tank warfare by Frank Mitchell who was a tank commander in WWI and is describing the German Spring offensive in April 1918. The source says that the tanks drove straight into the German soldiers and that they quickly destroyed the German threat. Tanks were a large metal vehicle which had cannons and machine guns on them. They were able to pretty much destroy everything that was in front of them. The sources are useful to someone studying military technology and tactics during the first world war because it shows how Britain were so much more advanced than the opposition. Tanks were really good as they could conquer a lot of land in a short amount of time than if it was just soldiers. ","The student provides a basic analysis of both sources, identifying relevant features and explaining their significance. For Source B, the student explains the concept of a creeping barrage and its role in British military tactics. For Source C, the student describes the effectiveness of tanks, particularly the 'Whippets,' during the German Spring Offensive.

However, the evaluation of the sources' utility is quite simplistic. The student does not delve deeply into the provenance of the sources or provide extended reasoning supported by detailed factual knowledge. The analysis is more descriptive than evaluative, focusing on what the sources show rather than how they are useful to a historian.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed contextual knowledge and evaluate the provenance of the sources. For example, discussing the reliability of a British newspaper published during the war or the firsthand account of a tank commander would add depth to the evaluation.

### Analysis:

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, with no noticeable spelling errors.
   - Punctuation is generally accurate, though there are minor issues. For example, the use of single quotation marks around ""Germany, Italy and Russia"" and ""Britain, France and Belgium"" is unconventional. Additionally, the sentence ""But because Serbia didn't want any Austro-Hungarian police in their country, so Austria-Hungary started preparing for war."" has an unnecessary conjunction ""so"" after the comma.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student uses grammar with general control of meaning. The overall meaning is clear, but there are some grammatical issues. For example, the sentence ""But because Serbia didn't want any Austro-Hungarian police in their country, so Austria-Hungary started preparing for war."" is grammatically incorrect due to the redundant conjunction ""so.""
   - Another example is the sentence ""Austria-Hungary knew it was Serbia so they began talks."" which could be clearer if rephrased to ""Austria-Hungary knew it was Serbia, so they began talks.""

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as ""alliance system,"" ""triple entente,"" ""triple alliance,"" and ""assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand."" These terms are appropriate and relevant to the topic.

### Conclusion:
The student's answer demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, with only minor errors that do not significantly hinder the overall meaning. The grammar is generally controlled, though there are a few areas that could be improved for clarity. The use of specialist terms is good and appropriate for the context.

Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer fits well within **Level 2**.

```","Source B shows a depiction of the Western Front with two types of new technology and tactics being shown. The Creeping barrage (presented in 1915) was when shells were fired in front of the advancing foot soldiers to hide them from enemy vision. This meant a decrease in loss of lives and allowed more prepared assaults rather than men going over the top and getting shot in their thousands. One of the reasons this was perfected in 1918 was the better use of communication. Radio being used more frequently helped communiction between aerial support, the troops and the artillery gunners. This minimised the chance of friendly deaths from friendly fire showing Source B is a very useful piece of evidence to show the impact and versatility of technology and tactic in the the First World War. 

Source C is a account of a tank commander who fought against the Germans in the Spring offensive. Tanks were first used in the Battle of the Somme and were unreliable and used sparingly. however as the war went on they were produced in vast numbers and used in groups. they could decimate trenches and cause great havoc. though the Germans did make some, the Allies used them in wide-scale front and they were pivotal to the end of the stalemate. Source C 
describes how the army constantly made new prototypes 
as the tanks so they could be faster and cause 
more casualties. This meant there was less hand to 
hand fighting because of the tanks physiological and 
devastating effects they had on the enemy. Source C 
is useful to a historian because it has personal 
story from someone actually experiencing the power 
of tanks, showing how the threat they brought. ","The student demonstrates a clear understanding of both sources and provides a detailed analysis of their content. For Source B, the student explains the concept of the creeping barrage and its significance in reducing casualties and improving communication during assaults. They also mention the role of radio communication in coordinating attacks, which adds depth to their evaluation. This shows a developed evaluation of the content of Source B, supported by contextual knowledge.

For Source C, the student describes the evolution and impact of tanks during the First World War, particularly during the German Spring Offensive. They highlight the improvements in tank design and their psychological and tactical effects on the battlefield. The student also notes that Source C is a first-hand account from a tank commander, which adds credibility and usefulness to the source. This demonstrates a developed evaluation of the content and provenance of Source C.

However, the student could improve their answer by explicitly linking the provenance of Source B to its utility. For example, they could discuss how the publication date and the intended audience of the British newspaper might influence the depiction of the battle. Additionally, the student could further develop their evaluation of the relationship between the two sources, as required for Level 4.

Overall, the answer falls into Level 3 due to the developed evaluation of both sources based on content and some consideration of provenance. To reach Level 4, the student would need to provide a more complex evaluation of the provenance of Source B and explicitly discuss the relationship between the sources.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan already had some problems to it, even before it was put into practise. For example it relied on the slow mobilisation of Russia. As the Germans would find out, the Russian army mobilised in just 10 days and had already consigned plans to attack in the East. This meant the Germans would have to fight a war on two fronts, exactly what was trying to be avoided. Furthermore after the death of Alfred Von Schlieffen in 1913, the next general made the army smaller for the assault on France, and also missed Holland from the plan entirely. This meant the Germans would have a weaker force in battle, additioning to them having to divide there army in half to fight in two fronts.

The German plan also relied on Belgium’s invasion which they thought would be quick and easy. However, the Belgian army put up stiff resistance trying forts and its small army, slowing down the German advancement. This gave France and Russia time to communicate and mobilise. Furthermore the German army underestimated the pact Britain had with Belgium in the 1890's, supporting its neutralaty. Therefore when they invaded Belgium and entered through France, The BEF was sent out to stop the Germany army. to May 1914 France and the BEF fought the Germans at the battle of Mons, contributing to stalemate the failure of the Schielfen plan.","The student demonstrates a clear understanding of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, moving beyond basic analysis to a more developed narrative. The answer is structured and well-ordered, with specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question.

In the first paragraph, the student explains the initial problems with the Schlieffen Plan, such as the reliance on the slow mobilisation of Russia and the changes made after Alfred Von Schlieffen's death. This shows a good understanding of the causation and the impact on the German strategy, indicating a level 3 response.

The second paragraph continues with the problems encountered during the execution of the plan, such as the resistance from Belgium and the involvement of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). The student explains how these factors contributed to the failure of the plan and the resulting stalemate, demonstrating developed sequencing and reasoning.

To reach level 4, the student would need to provide a more complex analysis, showing how tension increased at different stages and linking the different parts of the sequence more clearly. For example, they could explain how the failure of the Schlieffen Plan led to a prolonged war of attrition and the eventual trench warfare that defined the Western Front.

The Triple entente was used to make Germany back down but could of been a factor for war. Once the two sides were created it was clear War was imminent but Germany and its allies were keen for war then in contrast France and Russia and Britain made a pact us Allience to detterent Germany.

However the assasination os archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbia's black hand Gang also was a jumpstart to war. After the Assassin Austria-Hungery blamed Serbia and had intellignce the Black hand Gang was helped by the Serb government this gave the kaiser a motivation for war due to it alliance with Austria - Hungery. The Austrian government gave Serbia a 10 point deal which they agreed to all but one (letting Austrian soldiers into Serbia). Within a

days War was declared. Russia was dragged in due to its alliance with Serbia and the Germans started there Schlieffen plan in the West turning the Balkans war to a world war.

Finally the Moroccan Crisis was another reason why Germany were happy for a war to start.
France wanted to take over Morocco but Germany also wanted to expand its empire so the kaiser sent a warship into the ports of Morocco to show Germany wanted to be part of World affairs too. The French were outraged and a meeting in Algeciras (Spain) with the USA, Britain, Germany and France calmed the situation down preventing early war. The kaiser did this to see how Sent France could be pushed but Germany was humiliated when Britain Supported France due to there alliance. In 1911 the French were called into Morocco to settle a rebellion but Germany accused France of invading the country. Ultimately it was declared France would take full control of Morocco which humiliated the Kaiser for a Second time.

They mention the Triple Entente and the Triple Alliance, and how Germany felt encircled, which is relevant to the question. However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed factual knowledge, which is necessary for higher levels.

The student also addresses other factors, such as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the Moroccan Crisis.

","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, I will assess the student's answer focusing on Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG).

### Analysis:

1. **Spelling:**
   - There are several spelling errors: ""Britian"" (Britain), ""could of"" (could have), ""Allience"" (Alliance), ""assasination"" (assassination), ""os"" (of), ""Austria-Hungery"" (Austria-Hungary), ""intellignce"" (intelligence), ""there"" (their), ""days"" (day's), ""Sent"" (see how far France), ""therefor"" (therefore).
   - Despite these errors, the majority of the words are spelled correctly.

2. **Punctuation:**
   - There are multiple punctuation errors: missing commas, incorrect use of periods, and lack of apostrophes (e.g., ""days War"" should be ""day's War"").
   - Some sentences are run-on and could benefit from better punctuation to improve clarity.

3. **Grammar:**
   - The grammar is generally understandable but has several issues: ""could of been"" should be ""could have been,"" ""detterent"" should be ""deterrent,"" ""us Allience"" should be ""as an Alliance,"" ""assasination os"" should be ""assassination of,"" ""intellignce"" should be ""intelligence,"" ""there Schlieffen plan"" should be ""their Schlieffen plan,"" ""Sent France"" should be ""see how far France,"" ""there alliance"" should be ""their alliance,"" ""therefor"" should be ""therefore.""
   - The overall meaning is generally clear, but the errors do hinder the flow and clarity of the response.

4. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses several specialist terms related to the topic: ""Triple Entente,"" ""Triple Alliance,"" ""Schlieffen plan,"" ""Moroccan Crisis,"" ""archduke Franz Ferdinand,"" ""Black Hand Gang,"" ""Algeciras.""
   - The range of specialist terms is good, though not exceptionally wide.

### Conclusion:
Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme:

- **Level 1:** The answer does not meet the criteria for consistent accuracy in spelling and punctuation, nor does it show effective control of grammar.
- **Level 2:** The answer shows considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, with general control of grammar. The range of specialist terms is good.
- **Level 3:** The answer shows reasonable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, with some control of grammar. The range of specialist terms is limited but present.

Considering the student's performance and the forgiving nature of the grading, the answer fits best in **Level 2**. The errors are notable but do not severely hinder the overall meaning, and the use of specialist terms is good.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B and Source C are both very useful in helping historian understand tactics used in the war and the development of weaponry. Source B shows a artillery barrage which was the tactic the British used to make advances on the German trenches. An Artillery Barrage would consist of shooting multiple rounds of artillery on a set timetable at different distances to provide British troops in No Man's Land cover from any enemy defenses allowing the troops to cross No Man's Land with greater ease leading to a greater number of attacks onto German trenches. This source shows how tactics evolved throughout the war as they had thought of a more viable way of crossing No Man's Land with less German threat. Source C shows the evolution of tanks. At the start of World War 1 tanks were sent out on their own slowly, not posing much of threat to the enemy, but throughout the war tanks became one of the greatest threats to an enemy due to their improved speed and tactics used around them. The creeping barrage was one of the most successful tactics used at war. This would consist of sending out around a dozen tanks onto No man's land with hundreds of soldiers behind them. The soldiers behind would be safe to another German defenses because of the tanks blocking any bullets, also creating an easier way into enemy trenches because tanks would destroy any barbed wire in its way. Tanks would also have 360 machine guns attached to the top allowing it to send cover fire at German's.","The student demonstrates a clear understanding of both sources and their relevance to military technology and tactics in the First World War. They provide a detailed analysis of Source B, explaining the concept of an artillery barrage and how it was used to protect advancing troops. This shows a good grasp of the tactics used and how they evolved to increase the effectiveness of attacks on enemy trenches.

For Source C, the student explains the development and use of tanks, particularly the 'Whippets,' and how they were employed to counter German threats during the Spring Offensive. They highlight the evolution of tank tactics from the beginning of the war to the later stages, showing how tanks became a significant threat due to their improved speed and the tactics used around them.

The student also mentions the 'creeping barrage' tactic, although this is not directly referenced in the sources provided. This shows an understanding of the broader context of military tactics during the war, even if it is not directly supported by the sources.

However, the student does not explicitly evaluate the provenance of the sources, which is necessary for a higher-level response. They do not discuss the reliability or perspective of the sources, such as the fact that Source B is a newspaper picture from 1917, which might have been intended to boost public morale, or that Source C is a post-war account by a tank commander, which might be influenced by personal experiences and hindsight.

Overall, the answer demonstrates developed evaluation of the content of both sources and shows good contextual knowledge. To reach the highest level, the student would need to include a more explicit evaluation of the provenance and discuss how this affects the utility of the sources.

1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per unit} - \text{Variable Costs per unit}}
     \]
   - The fixed costs are £10,000.
   - The new selling price per unit is £6.50.
   - The variable costs per unit are £2.50.
   - Substituting these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]
   - The Answer correctly identifies the new break-even level of output as 2,500 units.

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]
   - The Answer does not explicitly state the decrease in the break-even level of output as 1,500 units.

**Grading:**
- The Answer correctly identifies the new break-even level of output as 2,500 units, which aligns with the substitution into the correct formula. This earns 1 mark.
- The Answer does not explicitly calculate or state the decrease in the break-even level of output as 1,500 units, so it does not earn the second mark.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen plan led to problems throughout Europe in 1914. The plan was for Germans to reach Paris in 6-10 weeks before Russia could mobilize its army. However, the Kaiser decided to pass through Belgium before going to Paris as he believed the French wouldn't expect this. Britain had made an agreement with Belgium to defend them if any country steps into their land, which led to Britain declaring war on the Germans, ruining their plans of reaching Paris in 6-10 weeks. This led to the German offensive on Verdun, an important French city historically. The Germans didn't want to reach Verdun they just wanted to bleed the French dry out of its artillery. The French responded by saying, 'we don't give Verdun up no matter what' France was near breaking point at the time of Britains defensive efforts at Marne. Britain launched an attack on the Germans at river Marne to relieve pressure of French soldiers in Verdun. This worked and France had saved Verdun. despite French and British soldiers having more deaths they saw this as a victory as they had more men to lose than the Germans who lost a lot of soldiers.","The student provides a structured account of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, demonstrating specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question. The answer begins by outlining the original plan and its intended timeline, then explains the deviation through Belgium and the resulting British involvement. This shows a simple analysis of causation/consequence, moving the answer beyond Level 1.

The student further explains the German offensive on Verdun and the subsequent Battle of the Marne, showing an understanding of sequencing and the impact of these events. However, the analysis lacks depth and complexity, particularly in explaining how these events led to broader problems in 1914. The focus is more on the immediate military actions rather than the wider implications and tensions.

To reach Level 3, the answer would need to provide a more developed analysis, linking the events to the overall stalemate on the Western Front and the broader consequences for the war. The answer should also include more detailed factual knowledge and reasoning to support the analysis.

Firstly many of the powerful nations believed an alliance led to even greater power for both countries. Many leaders were power hungry and wanted to be the most powerful army which led to countries trying to test and break other alliances. The Germans tested the entente cordiale between France and Britain at the Morocco crisis. France wanted to colonise Morocco, Britain agreed and allowed France to do this. However Germany decided to see how strong the alliance was and defended Morocco from being colonised which created the tension between the entente cordiale and Germany. Tension between Russia and Austria rose during the Balkan crisis. Austria had annexed Bosnia which upset Serbia who asked their Slavic brothers Russia to defend them if war happened between Serbia and Austria. Austria had asked Germany for support after hearing this news leading Germany sending Austria a 'Blank Cheque' meaning they will defend Austria no matter what strengthening their alliance.

In conclusion, Alliance had a huge part to play in the beginning of World War 1 but so did power wanted by leaders who wanted to grow their empires.","The student begins by addressing the given factor, the alliance system, and provides a brief explanation of how alliances contributed to the tensions leading up to the First World War. They mention the power dynamics and the desire for greater power among nations, which is relevant to the question. The student provides specific examples, such as the Morocco crisis and the Balkan crisis, to illustrate how alliances created tensions between countries. This shows a good range of factual knowledge and understanding.

However, the explanation remains somewhat simple and lacks the depth and complexity required for higher levels. The student does not fully develop the reasoning behind why these alliances led to the war, nor do they explore the relationships between different causes in a complex manner. The conclusion is brief and does not add much to the argument, merely restating that alliances and power ambitions played a role.

To reach Level 3, the student would need to provide a more developed explanation of the stated factor and other factors, showing a sustained line of reasoning with coherence and logical structure.

Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families.

The learner’s achievement in SPaG does not reach the threshold performance level, for example, errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar severely hinder meaning.",,"I slightly agree with this statement the alliance system lead to starting of the First World War. Firstly many of the powerful nations believed an alliance led to even greater power for both countries. Many leaders were power hungry and wanted to be the most powerful army which led to countries trying to test and break other alliances. The Germans tested the entente cordiale between France and Britain at the Morocco crisis. France wanted to colonise Morocco, Britain agreed and allowed France to do this. However Germany decided to see how strong the alliance was and defended Morocco from being colonised which created the tension between the entente cordiale and Germany. Tension between Russia and Austria rose during the Balkan crisis. Austria had annexed Bosnia which upset Serbia who asked their Slavic brothers Russia to defend them if war happened between Serbia and Austria. Austria had asked Germany for support after hearing this news leading Germany sending Austria a 'Blank Cheque' meaning they will defend Austria no matter what strengthening their alliance.

In conclusion, Alliance had a huge part to play in the beginning of World War 1 but so did power wanted by leaders who wanted to grow their empires.","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's assess the student's answer for Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG).

### Analysis:

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors:
     - ""lead"" should be ""led"" in ""the alliance system lead to starting of the First World War.""
     - ""entente cordiale"" should be capitalized as ""Entente Cordiale.""
     - ""Morocco crisis"" should be ""Moroccan Crisis.""
     - ""Balkan crisis"" should be ""Balkan Crisis.""
     - ""World War 1"" should be ""World War I.""
   - Punctuation is generally accurate, but there are some issues:
     - Missing comma after ""Firstly.""
     - Missing comma after ""In conclusion.""
     - The sentence ""Firstly many of the powerful nations believed an alliance led to even greater power for both countries."" could be clearer with a comma after ""Firstly.""

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are some areas for improvement:
     - ""Alliance had a huge part to play"" should be ""The alliance system had a huge part to play.""
     - ""power wanted by leaders"" should be ""the power sought by leaders.""
     - ""Germany sending Austria a 'Blank Cheque'"" should be ""Germany sent Austria a 'Blank Cheque.'""

3. **Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as ""entente cordiale,"" ""Moroccan Crisis,"" ""Balkan Crisis,"" ""annexed,"" and ""Blank Cheque.""

### Conclusion:
The student demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, with some minor errors that do not significantly hinder the overall meaning. The grammar is generally controlled, and the use of specialist terms is appropriate and varied.

### Marks Awarded:
Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer fits well within **Level 2**. The errors present are minor and do not severely impact the overall understanding of the response.

  - Therefore, by setting up Lili Heating Ltd she can be her own boss and make her own decisions. She no longer has to carry out repairs on houses for someone else (AO3a).

    - []","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.",A nonfinancial impact is on the shareholders of customers her USP is that she is female and believes this will allow her to connect closer with her target audience of females. If she can connect with the target audience then they are likely to come back if they’re any other problems but are also likely to advise their friends family to go to Lili Heating LTD if they have any issues.,"The candidate identifies a non-financial impact related to Amelia's unique selling point (USP) of being a female plumber, which allows her to connect more closely with her target audience of females. This is a valid point and aligns with the indicative content that suggests Amelia's gender could be a driving force in her business success.

However, the response lacks depth and detailed development. The candidate mentions that connecting with the target audience could lead to repeat business and recommendations, but this point is not fully developed or linked to broader business concepts. The response does not explore other non-financial aims such as gaining independence or the challenge of setting up a business in a competitive market, which are also relevant to the question.

In terms of application (AO2), the response is somewhat contextualized with references to Amelia's USP and target audience. However, it lacks the detailed application of business concepts and issues to the business context that is required for higher levels.

For analysis (AO3a), the response attempts to deconstruct the business information but does so in a limited manner. The connections between points are not fully developed, and the reasoning lacks depth.

Overall, the response fits best within Level 1 of the mark scheme. It shows limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context and attempts to deconstruct business information with limited connections between points.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer ""promotion"" does state one element of the marketing mix. According to the Mark Scheme, acceptable elements include place, promotion, and product. Therefore, the answer meets this criterion.

### Application of Context

- **Evidence of Application:**
  - The Mark Scheme requires evidence of application to award 1 mark. The answer ""promotion"" does not provide any specific application to Lili Heating Ltd. or Amelia's business context. For example, it does not mention how promotion will be used to attract customers or any specific promotional methods that Amelia might use. The example answers in the Mark Scheme provide specific applications, such as ""Promotion methods to attract female customers,"" which directly ties the element to the business context.

### Conclusion

- The answer ""promotion"" correctly identifies an element of the marketing mix but lacks the necessary application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd. to be awarded a mark.

### Final Mark

- **0 marks**: The answer does not fulfill the requirement of providing evidence of application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

### Summary

- The answer correctly identifies an element of the marketing mix (promotion).
- The answer lacks specific application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd., which is necessary to award a mark according to the Mark Scheme.

Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria:

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer does not directly outline a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. Instead, it focuses on the unique selling point (USP) of the business, which is not directly linked to the government's interest. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The answer does not link the USP to any government interest, such as tax collection or employment. It merely states that the USP allows Amelia to connect with female customers. This is a valid point but not linked to the government's interest. Therefore, it can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

- **Example answers:**
  - The example answers provided in the mark scheme include reasons such as tax collection and employment, which are directly linked to the government's interest. The given answer does not align with these examples.

- **Award any other valid answer:**
  - While the answer is valid in the context of the business's USP, it does not provide a reason why the government would want the business to be successful. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a valid answer in this context.

- **To award 2 marks there must be linked development and evidence of application:**
  - There is no linked development or evidence of application to the government's interest in the success of Lili Heating Ltd.

Based on the evaluation, the answer does not meet the criteria for 2 marks as it does not link the USP to a reason why the government would want the business to be successful. It can only be awarded 1 mark for providing a valid point about the business's USP.

  example_answer: 
    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","I believe Lili Heating LTD should choose option 2 because there are so many social media users and people think the business is good can share the company online easier. With her business being plumbing she is going to be needed to be concentrated online and people will find it easier if her business is being advertised on social media.

If she was to have a discounted price for females then she will have to advertise this offer and people are more likely to notice something online then they are in person.

In conclusion promoting her product online will help her reach her target customer of females and also another customer group of males which means she is likely to have more people interested in her business leading to more sales which will lead to a higher profit.

","The candidate begins by stating that Lili Heating Ltd should choose option 2, which is to use social media for promotion. They provide some reasoning for this choice, mentioning the large number of social media users and the ease of sharing the company online. This demonstrates some application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts (AO2), but it is not detailed or specific to the context of Lili Heating Ltd, thus fitting Level 1 criteria.

The candidate attempts to deconstruct the business information by discussing the potential benefits of social media advertising and the drawbacks of offering discounted prices to females. However, the connections between points are limited and lack depth, fitting the Level 1 criteria for AO3a.

The final conclusion reiterates the initial choice and provides a simple justification, mentioning that promoting online will help reach a broader customer base, leading to more sales and higher profit. This is a basic evaluation with minimal justification, fitting Level 1 criteria for AO3b.

Overall, the answer demonstrates limited understanding and basic analysis with minimal justification.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer provided is: ""It won't always be windy so possibility of no energy.""
   - This statement identifies a risk related to the variability of wind, which could lead to periods where no energy is generated. This is a valid risk for investors in a wind farm, as the profitability and reliability of their investment depend on consistent energy production.
   - The context supports this risk because Ripple is a wind farm, and wind energy generation is inherently dependent on weather conditions. If there is no wind, the wind farm cannot generate energy, which could affect the return on investment for the investors.

### Conclusion:
The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple by pointing out the dependency on wind for energy generation. This aligns with the marking criteria and is supported by the context provided.

Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria and example answers provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The candidate states, ""Customers are able to give their opinion and get the product adapted to that opinion."" This implies a benefit to customers as it suggests that their needs and preferences are taken into account, leading to a more personalized service. However, the benefit is not explicitly clear in terms of how it directly impacts the customer, such as receiving the correct energy plan or investment amount.

### Example Answers

- **Customers will receive the correct green energy plan (1):**
  - The candidate's answer does not explicitly mention receiving the correct green energy plan. It implies customization but does not directly state the benefit in terms of the energy plan.

- **This will make sure they receive the correct amount of energy for their needs (1):**
  - The answer does not specify that customers will receive the correct amount of energy for their needs. It only mentions that the product will be adapted to their opinion, which is a more general statement.

- **Customers will invest the correct amount of money into the wind farm (1):**
  - The response does not address the investment aspect at all.

- **This will lead them to get the best return on their money (1):**
  - There is no mention of financial returns or investment benefits in the candidate's answer.

### Marking Notes

- **Award up to 2 marks for linked points outlining a benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The candidate's answer does not provide linked points. It is a single statement without further development or linkage to specific benefits.

- **Award a maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The answer is not linked and does not provide a clear, specific benefit. It is a general statement about customization.

- **To award 2 marks there must be linked development and evidence of application:**
  - There is no linked development or specific application to the context of Ripple's services.

### Conclusion

The candidate's answer is too general and lacks specific details about the benefits to customers. It does not clearly outline how the customization of the product (energy plan) directly benefits the customer in terms of receiving the correct amount of energy or making the correct investment.

**Marks Awarded: 1**

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

Also if the training is free then the business won’t have to spend money on employee training then there will be less cash outflow in the business leading to a higher profit.

If taxes paid by smaller business was to happen then the business would face less cash out flow but would still have to pay some taxes and all training required. Therefore option 2 is the better option for Ripple.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 2 would have a more significant impact on Ripple's success. They provide some application of knowledge (AO2) by discussing the benefits of free training for employees, such as better service and maintenance capabilities, and reduced cash outflow leading to higher profit. This application is sound but not detailed, placing it in Level 2.

The candidate then compares Option 2 with Option 1, noting that while reduced taxes would also decrease cash outflow, the business would still incur training costs. This comparison shows some interconnected points and chains of reasoning (AO3a), but there are logical inconsistencies, such as not fully exploring the potential benefits of reduced taxes. Therefore, AO3a is also placed in Level 2.

The final judgement (AO3b) is simple and based on a limited evaluation of the information, as it does not thoroughly consider all aspects of both options. This places AO3b in Level 1.

This is why Ripple's claims of being able to supply energy for cheaper than competitors will attract more customers. Also, if the price is based on how much they need then there won't be any wasted energy and customers get spend equeivalent to how much they need leading to more sales.
","The candidate begins by stating that price is important to Ripple's marketing mix, but the explanation is somewhat vague and lacks depth. The candidate mentions that if Ripple's prices are not suitable, customers might choose competitors with cheaper prices, which is a valid point but is not elaborated upon sufficiently. The reference to Ripple's claim of supplying energy cheaper than competitors is relevant and shows some application to the business context (AO2).

However, the explanation lacks detailed interconnected points and logical chains of reasoning (AO3a). The candidate briefly touches on the idea that pricing based on energy needs can prevent waste and lead to more sales, but this point is not fully developed or supported with detailed reasoning.

  - 3",,Internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate because the internet might say where your location is a rough area and no one will want to come to your business.,"This question requires the candidate to 'Explain one way'. The candidate has suggested a way through ""the internet might say where your location is a rough area"" and this is developed through ""no one will want to come to your business"". However, the explanation lacks depth and does not fully align with the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of a way (1 mark)**:
  - The candidate identifies a way by stating ""the internet might say where your location is a rough area"". This is a valid point as it suggests that online information about the area could influence business location decisions. **(1 mark)**

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks)**:
  - The candidate attempts to explain the way by stating ""no one will want to come to your business"". This explanation is somewhat relevant but lacks depth and clarity. It does not fully explain how the internet's portrayal of the area affects the business's decision on location. The explanation could be more detailed, such as discussing how negative online reviews or crime statistics available on the internet could deter customers and influence the business to choose a different location. **(0 marks)**

The candidate's response is not as developed as the example answers provided in the mark scheme. The explanation is too brief and does not fully explore the impact of the internet on the business's location decision.

1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is: 
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per unit} - \text{Variable Costs per unit}}
     \]
   - The correct substitution should be:
     \[
     \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50}
     \]
   - The given Answer shows:
     \[
     10,000 / 2.5 = 1,000
     \]
     This is incorrect as it does not follow the correct formula.

2. **Calculation of new break-even level of output:**
   - The correct calculation should be:
     \[
     \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]
   - The given Answer shows:
     \[
     10,000/4 = 2500
     \]
     This part is correct, even though the initial substitution was incorrect.

3. **Calculation of decrease in break-even level of output:**
   - The correct calculation should be:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]
   - The given Answer does not explicitly show this step, but it does correctly identify the new break-even level of output as 2,500 units.

**Marking:**
- For the correct calculation of the new break-even level of output (2,500 units), despite the incorrect initial substitution, 1 mark can be awarded.
- The final step of calculating the decrease (4,000 - 2,500 = 1,500 units) is missing, so no mark can be awarded for this part.

    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).
","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","I would pick option 2 because this will help the business by making the employees already trained and ready. This means they will be doing a good job and make much more money for the business.
","The candidate's response is very brief and lacks depth. They state that they would pick option 2 because it will help the business by having trained employees, which means they will do a good job and make more money for the business. 

**Application (AO2):**
- The response shows limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context. The candidate mentions that trained employees will do a good job and make more money, but this is a very basic point and lacks specific context related to Ripple.

**Analysis (AO3a):**
- The response attempts to deconstruct business information but finds limited connections between points. The candidate does not provide interconnected points or chains of reasoning. The statement is very simplistic and does not delve into how trained employees will specifically benefit Ripple.

**Evaluation (AO3b):**
- The response makes a judgement but provides a very simple justification based on limited evaluation of business information and issues relevant to the choice made. The candidate does not explore the implications or potential drawbacks of the option chosen.

Overall, the response fits the criteria for Level 1. It demonstrates a basic understanding of business concepts and makes simple connections between points, but lacks depth and detailed evaluation.

- **Response:** ""One advantage of starting a private limited company is that you don't need to pay debts off of which you may have outside the business.""
- **Evaluation:** The candidate identifies an advantage related to limited liability, which is a valid point. This matches the example answer ""The owners would have limited liability."" Therefore, this criterion is satisfied.
- **Mark Awarded:** 1 mark

#### Explanation of the Identified Advantage
- **Criteria:** Explanation of the identified advantage: 2 marks
- **Response:** ""you don't need to pay debts off of which you may have outside the business.""
- **Evaluation:** The explanation provided is somewhat vague and does not clearly articulate why limited liability is beneficial. The mark scheme example explains that ""any debts are the responsibility of the business"" and ""the personal possessions of the owners will not have to be sold to pay the debts of the business."" The candidate's response does not fully develop this idea. Therefore, this criterion is not fully satisfied.

total_marks:
  - 2",,"10,000 / 2.5 = 4,000","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's evaluate the given Answer step by step:

1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per unit} - \text{Variable Costs per unit}}
     \]
   - The fixed costs are £10,000.
   - The new selling price per unit is £6.50.
   - The variable costs per unit are £2.50.
   - Substituting these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

Now, let's compare this with the given Answer:

- The given Answer is: ""10,000 / 2.5 = 4,000""

- **Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark**
  - The answer identifies a disadvantage: ""makes the employee become unhappy."" This satisfies the first marking criterion by clearly stating a disadvantage of not paying employees on time.

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The answer provides some explanation of the disadvantage: ""With this mindset, they won't pay employees won't work as hard as before."" This partially explains the consequence of employees becoming unhappy, which is a decrease in their work effort.
  - However, the explanation lacks depth and does not fully develop the point. It does not explicitly link the decrease in work effort to potential business impacts such as reduced productivity or problems meeting customer orders, which are examples given in the mark scheme.

**Overall Assessment:**
- The answer identifies a disadvantage and provides a basic explanation, but it lacks a fully developed rationale that connects the disadvantage to broader business impacts.

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer states, ""A business plan can help as it sets goals for the year such as make X amount of profit."" This outlines a way financial information can help forecast success by setting profit goals. However, it lacks specific financial tools or methods (e.g., cash-flow forecast, break-even analysis) that are typically used to forecast success. Therefore, this criterion is partially met.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The answer does not provide linked development. It mentions setting profit goals but does not explain how this helps forecast success or link it to specific financial information in the business plan. Therefore, this criterion is not fully met.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - Since the points are not linked and the answer lacks development, it can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.

The first impact is that the information could be out of date, which is developed through ""therefore useless to her business."" The second impact is that the data might not be relevant to her business, developed through ""she would be using data collected that's not even relevant.""

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","The importance of price for Ripple is that it claims its the best priced energy efficient company which attracts customers to the company as the customers would want cheap energy so they can have more items such as going shopping.
Price also helps Ripple because with the money provided by customers, they can upgrade technology and make it even cheaper.","The candidate's response is brief and lacks depth. 

In the first paragraph, the candidate mentions that Ripple claims to be the best-priced energy-efficient company, which attracts customers. This is a valid point but is not elaborated upon. The candidate could have expanded on how being competitively priced can help Ripple attract more customers, especially those who are price-sensitive, and how this aligns with Ripple's business model of providing affordable green energy.

In the second paragraph, the candidate states that the money provided by customers can be used to upgrade technology and make it even cheaper. This point is relevant but again lacks detail. The candidate could have discussed how reinvesting in technology can lead to cost savings and further price reductions, making Ripple more competitive in the market.

Overall, the response demonstrates some understanding of the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix but lacks detailed application and interconnected points. The evaluation is very limited and does not provide a thorough justification based on the information provided.

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer identifies an advantage: ""you can take loans out from banks to use for setting up a business."" However, this is not a specific advantage of starting a business as a private limited company. The mark scheme examples focus on limited liability and the ability to sell shares, which are specific to private limited companies. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**
  - The answer does not provide an explanation of the identified advantage. It simply states that loans can be taken out from banks, but it does not explain why this is an advantage specific to a private limited company. The mark scheme requires an explanation that ties the advantage directly to the nature of a private limited company, such as limited liability or the ability to raise finance through selling shares. This criterion is not met.

**Overall Assessment:**
- The answer does not meet the criteria for identifying a specific advantage of starting a business as a private limited company.
- The answer does not provide an explanation that ties the advantage to the nature of a private limited company.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate attempts to explain the way by mentioning, ""depending on how far away the buyer lives, the price of delivery could be higher.""

  - The explanation does not clearly link the identified way to the impact on the business's location choice.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B would be useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War. The image shows the creeping barrage. Artillery strikes would be on a timer and every time there was an explosion, the Brits would move forward. When in the trench, they would use the sword on the end of their gun to attack. Source B also shows planes flying over the battlefield. This could be showing airstrikes and dogfights between the Brits and Germany.

Source C would be useful to an extent to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War. The text is showing a tank commander's experience of the war and is telling the story of a tank battle during the German spring offensive. This could not be true on the other hand and it could be a British soldier Trying to make his side look good. ","The student begins by identifying relevant features of Source B, such as the depiction of the creeping barrage and the use of planes. They provide some contextual knowledge about the tactics used, such as the timed artillery strikes and the use of bayonets. However, the analysis is somewhat basic and lacks depth. The student does not fully explain how these features are useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.

In the second paragraph, the student identifies that Source C is a first-hand account from a tank commander and describes a tank battle during the German Spring Offensive. They acknowledge the potential bias in the source, suggesting it could be an attempt to make the British side look good. This shows some evaluation of the provenance, but it is not fully developed.

To improve, the student could provide more detailed contextual knowledge and a more thorough evaluation of the provenance of both sources. They should also explicitly link their analysis back to the question of how useful the sources are to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.

The business increases the selling price of its product to 6.50 per unit.

  - Substitution into correct formula
  - £10 000 ÷ (£6.50 – £2.50) = 2,500 units

total_marks:
  - 2",,"10,000 ÷ 2.50 = 4000,","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's evaluate the given Answer step by step:

1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per unit} - \text{Variable Costs per unit}}
     \]
   - The fixed costs are £10,000.
   - The new selling price per unit is £6.50.
   - The variable costs per unit are £2.50.
   - Substituting these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

Now, let's compare this with the given Answer:

- The given Answer states: ""10,000 ÷ 2.50 = 4000,""
  - This calculation is incorrect and does not follow the correct formula for the break-even level of output.
  - The correct formula involves subtracting the variable costs per unit from the selling price per unit before dividing the fixed costs by this difference.

Since the given Answer does not show the correct substitution into the formula and does not provide the correct final answer, it does not meet the criteria for awarding marks.

- **Identification of a way:**
  - The answer identifies a way a small business could become more competitive: ""by making more products."" This satisfies the first marking criterion. (1 mark)

- **Explanation of the way:**
  - The explanation provided is that ""Making different versions of products could result in a further range of customers."" This partially explains how making more products could lead to increased competitiveness by attracting a broader customer base. However, the explanation lacks depth and does not fully develop the idea.
  - The answer further states, ""therefore leading to more profit."" This attempts to link the increased range of customers to higher profitability, but it is somewhat vague and does not clearly connect to the idea of becoming more competitive.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers in the mark scheme provide a clear cause-and-effect relationship, such as ""charging lower prices"" leading to customers being ""more likely to buy the product"" and ""attracting customers from its competitors.""
- The given answer does not fully develop the cause-and-effect relationship as clearly as the example answers.

**Marking Notes:**
- The answer does not list more than one way, so it is not limited to a maximum of 1 mark.

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate states, ""An advantage of a small business meeting its legal obligations is that it can now sell products without a fine."" This identifies an advantage, which aligns with the example answer, ""A small business would not get sued for breaking the law."" Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. (1 mark)

- **Explanation of the advantage:**
  - The candidate does not provide further explanation of the advantage. The answer lacks development on how avoiding fines can benefit the business, such as preventing financial consequences or maintaining a positive image. The example answers provide further development, such as ""This means the business would not have to face financial consequences such as a fine"" and ""This will prevent the business from having a negative image."" The candidate's response does not meet this criterion. (0 marks)

Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.

Financial information could help her company because then she would know what to do in regards of an overdraft and advertising.,"**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer mentions that financial information could help Amelia ""know what to do in regards of an overdraft and advertising."" This is a valid point but lacks specific detail on how financial information directly helps forecast success. The example answers provide specific financial tools like cash-flow forecasts or break-even analysis, which are not mentioned here. Therefore, this criterion is partially met.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The points in the answer are somewhat linked. The candidate mentions that financial information could help Amelia ""know what to do in regards of an overdraft and advertising,"" which implies a connection between financial planning and business decisions. However, the linkage is not strong or detailed enough to fully meet this criterion. The example answers show a clear cause-and-effect relationship, which is not as evident in this response.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - Given that the points are not strongly linked and the answer lacks specific financial tools or detailed explanation, it falls under the category of unlinked points. Therefore, it should be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

Fighting broke out between the two countries and other countries joined in, creating World War One. ","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's assess the student's answer for Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG).

### Analysis:

1. **Spelling:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there is a notable error: ""altimatum"" should be ""ultimatum.""

2. **Punctuation:**
   - The student uses punctuation with considerable accuracy. There are commas, periods, and an apostrophe used correctly. However, there is a minor issue with the comma usage in the sentence: ""The Black Hand gang and Austria-Hungary then had a conference and Austria-Hungary gave a ten point altimatum."" A comma after ""conference"" would improve clarity.

3. **Grammar:**
   - The student generally uses grammar with effective control of meaning. The sentences are coherent and the meaning is clear throughout the response.
   - There is a minor grammatical issue in the sentence: ""Serbia refused to have Austria-Hungarian police in their country so declined."" It would be clearer if it were written as: ""Serbia refused to have Austria-Hungarian police in their country, so they declined.""

4. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses several specialist terms appropriately, such as ""alliance system,"" ""triple alliance,"" ""assassination,"" ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand,"" ""Black Hand gang,"" and ""ultimatum"" (despite the misspelling).

### Conclusion:
The student's response demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, with only minor errors that do not significantly hinder meaning. The grammar is generally well-controlled, and the use of specialist terms is good.

Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer fits well within **Level 2**. The minor errors prevent it from reaching Level 1, but the overall performance is strong enough to warrant the higher end of Level 2.

This is then developed through the idea that this gives her a unique selling point. The candidate further develops this by stating that women will feel they can relate more closely to a woman doing repairs in their homes.

However, the response lacks depth and detailed interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning. The answer does not fully explore the implications of Amelia's unique selling point or how it might impact her business decisions and success. Additionally, the response does not provide multiple strands of development or consider other non-financial aims that might have influenced Amelia's decision.

In terms of application (AO2), the response is somewhat contextualized with references to Amelia being a woman in a male-dominated industry and the unique selling point. However, it lacks a broader application of business concepts and issues to the context of starting a new business.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - **Criteria:** The answer must state one element of the marketing mix.
   - **Evaluation:** The answer states ""Product,"" which is one of the elements of the marketing mix. This satisfies the criteria of stating an element of the marketing mix.

2. **Evidence of application.**
   - **Criteria:** To award 1 mark, there must be evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd.
   - **Evaluation:** The answer simply states ""Product"" without any additional context or application to Lili Heating Ltd. The mark scheme example answers provide specific applications, such as ""Product is to repair/install boilers,"" which directly relates to the business context. The given answer lacks this level of detail and does not provide any specific application to Lili Heating Ltd.

### Conclusion

- The answer successfully states one element of the marketing mix, which is ""Product.""
- However, the answer does not provide evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd, which is required to award the mark.

### Marks Awarded

- **0 marks**: The answer does not fulfill the requirement of providing evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd.

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer states, ""The government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful because they can tax them."" This outlines a reason why the government would want the business to be successful, but it lacks linked development. The mark scheme example, ""The government will collect more tax if Lili Heating Ltd is successful,"" is similar but more explicit in linking the success of the business to tax collection. Therefore, this criterion is partially met but not fully developed. **(0 marks)**

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - Since the answer does not provide linked development, it falls under the category of unlinked points.

    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd.

This could result in them being sued","The candidate's response is very brief and lacks depth. They state that Lili Heating Ltd should choose option 2 but do not provide any substantial reasoning or analysis to support this choice. The only point made is that offering discounts to female customers (option 1) could be seen as discriminatory against men, potentially leading to legal issues. 

**Application (AO2):** The response shows a very limited application of business concepts to the context of Lili Heating Ltd. The mention of potential discrimination is relevant but not explored in detail. This places AO2 in Level 1.

**Analysis (AO3a):** There is an attempt to deconstruct the issue by mentioning the potential legal ramifications of option 1, but this is not developed into interconnected points or logical chains of reasoning. This places AO3a in Level 1.

**Evaluation (AO3b):** The judgement is very simple and lacks a thorough evaluation of the business information and issues relevant to the choice made.

  - 1","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",If a wind turbine stops working they will have no source of profit,"Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer states, ""If a wind turbine stops working they will have no source of profit.""
   - This statement identifies a potential risk for investors, which is the operational failure of a wind turbine leading to a lack of profit. This aligns with the marking criteria of identifying a risk for investors.
   - The context supports this risk as it mentions that Ripple is a wind farm providing energy, and operational issues with wind turbines could indeed impact the profitability and energy supply.

### Conclusion:
- The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple, which is the potential operational failure of a wind turbine leading to no profit. This is a valid risk and is supported by the context provided.

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer states, ""Ripple can then find out what customers want and adjust their products or service to fit the majority."" This implies a benefit to customers as Ripple will tailor their offerings to better meet customer needs. However, the benefit is not explicitly clear or directly linked to the context of Ripple's green energy plans.

    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

This leads to more revenue and Ripple being able to breakeven.","The candidate's response is brief and lacks depth. They state that Option 1 would have the most significant impact because Ripple would have a higher income if not taxed by the government. However, the explanation is simplistic and does not provide a detailed application of business concepts or a thorough evaluation of the issues.

**Application (AO2):**
- The candidate mentions that not being taxed would lead to higher income and more revenue, which is a basic application of business concepts. However, this is not sufficiently detailed or contextualized to Ripple's specific situation. The response lacks references to the context provided, such as Ripple's business model, its green energy focus, or its consumer-owned structure.

**Analysis (AO3a):**
- The analysis is limited. The candidate does not deconstruct the business information or issues in detail. There are no interconnected points or logical chains of reasoning. The response does not explore how the increased revenue could be used, such as for investment in the wind farm or expansion into other green business ideas.

**Evaluation (AO3b):**
- The judgement is simple and based on a limited evaluation. The candidate concludes that higher income would lead to more revenue and the ability to break even, but this is not thoroughly justified. There is no consideration of potential drawbacks or other factors that could influence Ripple's success.

Overall, the response demonstrates a basic understanding of business concepts but lacks the depth and detail required for higher levels. The answer fits the criteria for Level 1, as it shows limited application, attempts to deconstruct business information with limited connections, and makes a simple judgement based on limited evaluation.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","Option 1 would have the most significant impact on the success of Ripple because if they aren't being taxed by the government, then they have a higher income coming in. This leads to more revenue and Ripple being able to breakeven.
","The candidate's response is very brief and lacks depth. It does not address the question of evaluating the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix. Instead, it makes a vague reference to an option that is not clearly defined in the context of the question. 

- **Knowledge and Understanding (AO1b):** The response does not demonstrate any knowledge or understanding of business concepts related to the marketing mix or pricing strategies. There is no use of business terminology. This places the response at Level 0 for AO1b.

- **Application (AO2):** There is no application of knowledge to the business context of Ripple. The response does not mention any specific details about Ripple or its pricing strategy. This places the response at Level 0 for AO2.

For example, if someone works a pool in their garden.","This question requires the candidate to 'Explain one advantage of starting a business as a private limited company'. The candidate's response does not align with the requirements of the question. Let's evaluate the response against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of an advantage**: The candidate states, ""An advantage of a PLC is that you work for people and not for the government."" This statement is incorrect and does not identify a valid advantage of a private limited company. The mark scheme provides examples such as limited liability or the ability to sell shares to raise finance. The candidate's response does not match any of these examples or any other valid advantage of a private limited company. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

- **Explanation of the identified advantage**: The candidate attempts to provide an example with ""For example, if someone works a pool in their garden."" However, this explanation is unclear and does not relate to any advantage of a private limited company. The mark scheme expects an explanation that elaborates on the identified advantage, such as explaining limited liability or the benefits of raising finance through selling shares. The candidate's explanation does not fulfill this requirement.

Overall, the candidate's response does not meet any of the criteria outlined in the mark scheme. The response is not relevant to the question and does not provide a valid advantage or explanation.

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The candidate identifies a way by stating, ""It could effect where they choose to locate because of the traffic."" This is a valid point as it relates to the consideration of foot traffic in choosing a business location. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. **(1 mark)**

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate attempts to explain the way by mentioning, ""They would want a lot of foot traffic and like in a popular place like London."" This partially explains the importance of foot traffic but does not directly link it to the impact of the internet.
  - The candidate further states, ""but it should not matter where the business is located because you can have things delivered to your house."" This statement introduces the concept of e-commerce but does not clearly explain how the internet affects the choice of location. The explanation is somewhat disjointed and lacks clarity in linking the internet's role to the location decision.
  - The explanation does not fully develop the idea that the internet allows businesses to operate without a physical retail location or the need for a location with good internet connections, as suggested in the mark scheme example answers.

Overall, the candidate identifies a valid point but does not fully develop the explanation in a clear and coherent manner. The answer partially meets the criteria for explanation but lacks depth and clarity.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```",The british used something called a creeping barrage and this is when you would use artillery fire as cover. This did result in some friendly casualties but it was effective. Source B shows that the lines are where the artillery fire is going to go and you can also see some shells landing right in front of them and move a few meters ahead. Source C tells us that they made a new tank called 'Whippet' and they had machine guns on the top. This tells us that tanks were a big game changer in the first World War.,"The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides some basic analysis. For Source B, they describe the use of a creeping barrage and explain how the artillery fire provided cover for advancing soldiers. For Source C, they mention the introduction of the 'Whippet' tank and its impact on the battlefield. However, the analysis is quite basic and lacks depth. There is no evaluation of the provenance of the sources, and the contextual knowledge provided is minimal.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed factual knowledge and a more developed evaluation of both the content and provenance of the sources. They should also consider the relationship between the sources and how they together provide a more comprehensive understanding of military technology and tactics during the First World War.

  - Substitution into correct formula
  - £10 000 ÷ (£6.50 – £2.50) = 2,500 units

  - 2",,"10,000 / 6.50 = 1538
breakeven = 10,0000
1,538 units","Based on the provided Question, Answer, and Mark Scheme, let's evaluate the given Answer step by step.

### Marking Criteria:
1. **Substitution into correct formula**:
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per unit} - \text{Variable Costs per unit}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values from Table 1:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{10,000}{6.50 - 2.50}
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{10,000}{4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of decrease in break-even level of output**:
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 - 2,500 = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

### Evaluation of the Given Answer:
- The given Answer states:
  \[
  10,000 / 6.50 = 1538
  \]
  - This calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the variable costs. The correct calculation should be:
    \[
    10,000 / (6.50 - 2.50) = 2,500 \text{ units}
    \]

- The given Answer also states:
  \[
  \text{breakeven} = 10,0000
  \]
  - This statement is unclear and seems to be a typographical error.

- The given Answer concludes with:
  \[
  1,538 \text{ units}
  \]
  - This is incorrect and does not follow from the correct formula.

### Mark Allocation:
- **Substitution into correct formula**: 0 marks (The formula used was incorrect)
- **Calculation of decrease in break-even level of output**: 0 marks (The final answer was incorrect and the working was not shown correctly)

### Final Marks:
- Total marks awarded: 0 out of 2

Instead, the answer focuses on the ease of tracking profits in a small business compared to a big business, which is not relevant to the question asked.

Let's evaluate the response against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of an advantage**: The candidate does not identify an advantage related to meeting legal obligations. The response discusses the ease of tracking profits, which is unrelated to legal obligations. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

- **Explanation of the advantage**: Since the candidate did not identify a relevant advantage, there is no explanation provided that ties back to meeting legal obligations. The explanation provided about tracking profits does not fulfill this criterion.

Given the marking notes and the example answers provided in the mark scheme, the candidate's response does not align with the expected answers. The response does not mention any legal obligations or their benefits, such as avoiding lawsuits, financial consequences, maintaining a positive image, or motivating employees.

The response also lacks a clear structure and does not develop a sustained line of reasoning.

To achieve a higher level, the student would need to provide a more detailed explanation of the Alliance System and how it contributed to the outbreak of the First World War.

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer states, ""it can show her if she needs advertisement that she could afford it."" This is a valid point as it indicates that financial information can help determine the affordability of advertising, which is a component of forecasting success. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The answer does not provide a linked development. It mentions the potential need for advertisement and affordability but does not link this to a specific financial tool or forecast (e.g., cash-flow forecast, break-even analysis) that would help in making this determination. Therefore, this criterion is not fully satisfied.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student has made several spelling errors: ""couldve"" should be ""could've,"" ""there"" should be ""their,"" and ""them"" should be ""those.""
   - Punctuation is inconsistent. For example, there is a missing comma after ""ready just in case,"" and the sentence is a run-on without proper punctuation to separate ideas.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student uses grammar with some control of meaning, but there are errors that slightly hinder the overall clarity. For example, ""them countries"" should be ""those countries,"" and ""there alliances"" should be ""their alliances.""
   - The sentence structure is somewhat awkward and could be improved for better clarity.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses some specialist terms such as ""Morocco crisis"" and ""Balkan crisis,"" which are appropriate for the context.

Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme:

- **Level 1:** The student does not meet the criteria for consistent accuracy in spelling and punctuation, nor do they demonstrate effective control of grammar.
- **Level 2:** The student does not meet the criteria for considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, nor do they demonstrate general control of grammar.
- **Level 3:** The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy, uses grammar with some control of meaning, and uses a limited range of specialist terms.

Considering the forgiving nature of the grading and the student's effort to use specialist terms, the answer fits best within **Level 3**.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer provided is ""The production.""
   - According to the mark scheme, acceptable elements of the marketing mix include place, promotion, and product. ""Production"" is not one of the four Ps of the marketing mix (Product, Price, Place, Promotion).
   - Therefore, the answer does not successfully state one of the elements of the marketing mix.

### Example Answers Comparison

- The example answers provided in the mark scheme are:
  - ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham"" (1)
  - ""Promotion methods to attract female customers"" (1)
  - ""Product is to repair/install boilers"" (1)

- The given answer ""The production"" does not align with any of these examples. It does not specify place, promotion, or product.

#### Marking Criteria 1: Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful.
- **Criteria Fulfilled?** No.
- **Evidence & Justification:** The answer states, ""They would want her to become successful because she can be the first millionaire female plumber."" This does not provide a clear reason why the government would want the business to be successful. The mark scheme example answers focus on tax collection and employment, which are clear benefits to the government. The provided answer does not link to these or similar points.

#### Marking Criteria 2: Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked.
- **Criteria Fulfilled?** No.
- **Evidence & Justification:** The answer does not provide linked points. It only mentions a potential personal achievement for Amelia without explaining how this benefits the government. The mark scheme requires linked development and evidence of application to award 2 marks, which is not present here.

### Conclusion
The answer does not meet the criteria for linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. It also does not provide any valid points that are linked to the government's interest. Therefore, the answer should be awarded 0 marks.

  example_answer: 
    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman.

They would get it at a discounted price. So I think she should use social media to promote herself and reach on social media. It be easy this is the first or the something like this is happening.,"The candidate's response is brief and lacks depth. They mention that offering discounts only to female customers might be seen as unfair, which is a valid point. However, the explanation is not well-developed and lacks business terminology and theory. The suggestion to use social media is mentioned but not elaborated upon.

**Application (AO2):**
- The candidate demonstrates limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the business context. They mention the potential unfairness of offering discounts only to female customers but do not provide a detailed explanation or context-specific examples. This places AO2 in Level 1.

**Analysis (AO3a):**
- The candidate attempts to deconstruct the issue but provides limited connections between points. The reasoning is not well-developed, and there are no logical chains of reasoning. This places AO3a in Level 1.

**Evaluation (AO3b):**
- The candidate makes a simple judgement that using social media is a better option but provides minimal justification. The evaluation is limited and lacks depth. This places AO3b in Level 1.

  - 1","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",What if it is not windy one day,"Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer provided is: ""What if it is not windy one day.""
   - This statement implies a risk related to the variability of wind, which could affect the energy production of the wind farm. If it is not windy, the wind farm may not generate enough energy, which could impact the return on investment for the investors.
   - The context mentions that Ripple is a wind farm, and the energy supply is based on wind conditions. Therefore, the risk of not having enough wind to generate energy is a valid concern for investors.
   - The mark scheme example answers include risks such as ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs,"" which is similar to the risk implied by the answer. The lack of wind directly affects energy production, which in turn affects the energy supply to investors' homes or businesses.

### Conclusion:
- The answer ""What if it is not windy one day"" successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple, as it highlights the dependency on wind conditions for energy production.
- This risk is supported by the context, which explains that Ripple's energy supply is based on wind farm production.

### Marks Awarded:
- The answer fulfills the criteria of stating one risk for investors in Ripple.
- Therefore, 1 mark should be awarded.

### Example Answer:
- **Coal**

### Answer Provided:
- **""Coal has decreased the most by 2.8, and Renewables has increased by 3.8""**

### Evaluation:

1. **Award mark if the example answer is mentioned exactly (case insensitive).**
   - The provided answer states, **""Coal has decreased the most by 2.8""**.
   - The term **""Coal""** is mentioned exactly as required by the mark scheme.

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer states, ""It gives you power in your home & and every person needs that."" This implies a benefit to customers, which is the provision of power to their homes.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).

    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",If the price is too large investors can wait because this the future and soon everyone will have one so the price will decrease because there is less demand.,"The candidate's response is very brief and lacks depth. It does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix. The response fails to apply knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the context of Ripple (AO2). There is no deconstruction of business information or issues, and no interconnected points with chains of reasoning (AO3a). The response also lacks a valid and well-reasoned conclusion based on a thorough evaluation of business information and issues (AO3b).

Overall, the response does not meet the criteria for Level 1. It contains no rewardable material and does not address the question effectively.

#### Identification of an Advantage
- **Criteria:** Identification of an advantage.
- **Response:** The answer does not clearly identify an advantage of starting a business as a private limited company.

- **Evaluation:** The answer does not satisfy this criterion.

#### Explanation of the Identified Advantage
- **Criteria:** Explanation of the identified advantage.
- **Response:** The answer does not provide an explanation of any identified advantage. The statement is not developed further to explain why not paying other companies money is an advantage or how it relates to being a private limited company.

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The answer does not clearly identify a specific way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate. The response focuses on physical location visibility rather than the impact of the internet. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

  - The explanation provided discusses the visibility of the business on a busy road versus a not busy road. This does not relate to how the internet affects the location choice. The response does not explain how the internet influences the decision-making process for the business location. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

26,000 units","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's evaluate the given Answer step by step:

1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per unit} - \text{Variable Costs per unit}}
     \]
   - The correct substitution should be:
     \[
     \frac{10,000}{6.50 - 2.50} = \frac{10,000}{4} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]
   - The given Answer does not show this correct substitution. Instead, it incorrectly calculates:
     \[
     10,000 ÷ 2.5 = 4,000
     \]
   - This step is incorrect.

2. **Calculation of decrease in break-even level of output:**
   - The correct decrease should be:
     \[
     4,000 - 2,500 = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]
   - The given Answer does not perform this calculation. Instead, it incorrectly calculates:
     \[
     4000 \times 6.50 = 26,000
     \]
   - This step is also incorrect.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The correct final answer should be:
     \[
     \text{Decrease} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]
   - The given Answer incorrectly states:
     \[
     26,000 \text{ units}
     \]

**Grading:**
- The given Answer does not show the correct substitution into the formula.
- The given Answer does not calculate the correct decrease in the break-even level of output.
- The final answer is incorrect.

**Identification of an advantage:**
- The answer identifies an advantage by stating, ""Business has a lesser chance of shutting down."" This aligns with the marking criteria of identifying an advantage, as it implies that meeting legal obligations helps ensure the business's continuity. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. (1 mark)

**Explanation of the advantage:**
- The explanation provided is ""as it is all legal."" This is a very brief explanation and does not fully develop the point. According to the mark scheme, a full explanation should elaborate on how meeting legal obligations prevents negative consequences such as fines, lawsuits, or a negative image, which in turn helps the business avoid shutting down. The answer does not sufficiently explain the connection between legality and the reduced risk of shutting down. Therefore, this criterion is not fully satisfied. (0 marks)

The candidate has suggested a disadvantage through ""Can lead to losing employees"" and this is developed through ""then other people won't join if you're not paying current employees"". Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark**
  - The candidate identifies a disadvantage by stating ""Can lead to losing employees"". This satisfies the first marking criterion. **(1 mark)**

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The candidate explains the disadvantage by stating ""then other people won't join if you're not paying current employees"". This explanation is somewhat developed but lacks depth. It implies that the business will have difficulty attracting new employees, which is a valid point but not fully elaborated.
  - The explanation could be further developed by discussing the potential impact on recruitment costs or productivity, similar to the example answers provided in the mark scheme. However, the candidate's response does provide a basic explanation. **(1 mark)**

Overall, the candidate's response identifies a disadvantage and provides a basic explanation, but it lacks the depth and detail needed for full marks.

#### Identification of an advantage:
- The answer does not clearly identify an advantage of using retained profit as a source of finance. The statement ""The retained profit will be used to make more money"" is too vague and does not directly address the specific advantages listed in the mark scheme, such as being a cheap source of finance or not paying interest.

#### Explaining the advantage:
- The explanation provided, ""which leads to higher profit,"" is not sufficiently developed. It does not explain why retained profit is advantageous compared to other sources of finance. The mark scheme expects an explanation that ties back to specific benefits like no interest payments, no dilution of ownership, or quicker decision-making.

### Marks Awarded:
- Identification of an advantage: 0 marks (The advantage is not clearly identified as per the mark scheme criteria).
- Explanation of the advantage: 0 marks (The explanation is not sufficiently developed and does not align with the mark scheme).

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer does not directly outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success. Instead, it mentions that being ""fully legal and pay taxes"" helps them get more customers, which is not directly related to financial forecasting. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The points in the answer are not linked. The statement ""helps them get more customers as they are fully legal and pay taxes etc."" does not provide a clear link to how financial information in a business plan could help forecast success. Thus, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - Since the points are not linked and the answer does not directly address how financial information in a business plan could help forecast success, it does not meet the criteria for even 1 mark. The response is too generic and lacks the necessary context and development.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer ""Quality"" does not directly state one of the traditional elements of the marketing mix (Product, Place, Promotion, Price). The elements of the marketing mix are typically defined as Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. ""Quality"" is not one of these elements, although it can be considered a characteristic of the ""Product"" element.
   - **Does not satisfy the criteria.**

### Example Answers Comparison

- **Example Answer 1:** ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham"" (1)
  - This example clearly states ""Place"" as an element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.
- **Example Answer 2:** ""Promotion methods to attract female customers"" (1)
  - This example clearly states ""Promotion"" as an element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.
- **Example Answer 3:** ""Product is to repair/install boilers"" (1)
  - This example clearly states ""Product"" as an element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

### Marking Notes

  - 2","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.",So she can make house values go up.,"The answer provided is ""So she can make house values go up.""

Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria:

### Marking Criteria:

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful.**
  - The answer does not provide a linked point. It states a potential impact (""make house values go up"") but does not explain why the government would want this to happen. There is no development or linkage to government interests such as tax revenue, employment, or economic growth.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked.**
  - The answer is not linked and does not provide a clear reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. It lacks the necessary development and context.

### Example Answers for Reference:

- ""The government will collect more tax if Lili Heating Ltd is successful (1).""
- ""Taxes will be based on the profits it makes from plumbing repairs (1).""
- ""The government will want more people to be employed (1).""
- ""Amelia may employ more female plumbers if the business is a success (1).""

### Marking Notes:

- **Award up to 2 marks for linked points.**
  - The answer does not provide linked points.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked.**
  - The answer does not provide a valid reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. It does not mention tax collection, employment, or any other government interest.

### Context:

- The context provided mentions Amelia Cooper starting her own plumbing business, Lili Heating Ltd, and her unique selling point as a female plumber. However, the answer does not utilize this context to explain why the government would want the business to be successful.

### Examiner Commentary:

The answer ""So she can make house values go up"" is not sufficient to meet the marking criteria. It does not provide a linked point or a valid reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful. There is no development or context provided to support the answer.

    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.

They try it out and see. A lot of people will see the promotion on social media and buy it as they will get more promotion and spend more.,"The candidate's response is very brief and lacks depth. They state that Option 2 should be chosen but do not provide a clear justification or detailed reasoning. The answer does not demonstrate a sound application of business concepts or issues to the context of Lili Heating Ltd (AO2). There is an attempt to deconstruct business information, but the connections between points are very limited and not well-developed (AO3a). The judgement provided is simple and lacks a thorough evaluation of the business information and issues relevant to the choice made (AO3b).

Overall, this answer should be placed in Level 1. The response demonstrates limited understanding of the business scenario, attempts basic analysis with limited connections between points, and provides a simple judgement with minimal justification.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Sources B and C could be very useful to a historian. This is because Source A shows us a creeping barrage. This is a fine example of both military technology and tactics. 

The creeping barrage displays how good and effective the artillery fire was. It was very accurate and hard to see although some men lost their lives due to missplaced shells. The creeping barrage is a good show of tactics as allied soldiers would slowly move forward while covered by the rain of artillery fire just in front of them, the smoke and dirt from explosions keeping them hidden. 

Another reason these sources are useful is Source C is written just after the war by a soldier, who was himself part of a tank battle. This makes the source reliable because the account wasn't slightly forgotten or changed from being passed on through stories and similar things. The account was also written straight after the war had finished meaning it's all still very fresh and accurate when writing the account.

Source c also talks about the newest and fastest tank the ""whippets"", this is an example of military technology advancements but also tactics changing.

As source c talks about several of the tanks coming at once to save him. However before the tanks were sent out in ones and twos and very easily picked off. So we can see from source c that tank tactics took a big change for the better. ","The student begins by identifying relevant features of Source B, explaining the concept of a creeping barrage and its significance in terms of military technology and tactics. They describe how the artillery fire was used to cover advancing soldiers, highlighting the effectiveness and risks associated with this tactic. This demonstrates a basic understanding of the source's content and its relevance to the question.

In the second paragraph, the student evaluates Source C, noting that it was written by a soldier who participated in a tank battle, which adds to its reliability. They mention that the account was written shortly after the war, making it fresh and accurate. This shows an attempt to evaluate the provenance of the source, which is a positive step towards higher-level analysis.

The student also discusses the advancements in military technology, specifically the introduction of the ""Whippets"" tanks, and how tactics evolved to use multiple tanks together rather than individually. This demonstrates an understanding of the changes in military tactics and technology during the war.

However, the evaluation of the sources could be more developed. The student should provide more specific factual knowledge to support their points and make a clearer connection to the utility of the sources for a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War. Additionally, the relationship between the sources could be explored further to reach a higher level of analysis.

Overall, the answer shows elements of both Level 2 and Level 3 criteria. The student provides simple evaluation of the content and provenance of the sources and demonstrates some extended reasoning. To reach Level 4, the student would need to provide more complex evaluation and sustained judgment based on content and provenance, as well as evaluate the relationship between the sources.

The Germans eventually made it through Belgium however they did get slowed down behind schedule. This gave France time to prepare but maybe not quite enough time as Germany still made massive advancements into France, and even got a couple of tens of kilometers away from Paris. 

After the Germans got pushed back a bit by Allied soldiers, they decided to dig in. They took high ground and built very permanent trenches. This was a problem for France because the Germans had no plans of leaving.

 This also lead to the race to the sea, where the enemys battled it out to have the best trench positions where eventually they had reached the sea after digging 400 miles of trenches.","The student provides a structured account of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, moving beyond basic statements. The answer identifies key events such as the German advance through Belgium, the involvement of Britain, and the subsequent trench warfare. This places the answer in Level 2, as it demonstrates specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question.

However, the analysis remains relatively simple and lacks the depth and range of accurate knowledge required for Level 3. The student mentions the delay caused by Belgian resistance and the subsequent trench warfare but does not develop these points with detailed factual knowledge or complex reasoning. The explanation of how these events led to problems is also somewhat brief and lacks the developed sequencing and reasoning needed for higher levels.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```",Source B is useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics during the First World War. For instance it shows a 'Artillery Barrage' where the Artillery behind the trench would fire over the trench to protect Running Soldiers as a line of defence. They would time 4 minutes between each so by when they had reached the trench they would use bayonets. Source C is useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics during the First World War. For instance it says about 'tank warfare' which was a military technology It was first used in the 'Battle of the Somme' where it had failed however they using it effectively in the 'Battle of Cambrai' where they would line with 300 tanks progress moving at around 5mph. This would act as a defence it would of then reached the trench where it would destroy Barbed wire. Then they would go in trench using hand combat. In Conclusion Source C and Source B both are useful to describing techniques and warfare tactics.,"The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides some basic analysis. For Source B, they describe the artillery barrage and its purpose, though the explanation is somewhat simplistic. For Source C, they mention tank warfare and provide some contextual knowledge about its use in battles such as the Battle of the Somme and the Battle of Cambrai. However, the analysis lacks depth and does not fully explain how these tactics and technologies were significant or how they evolved during the war.

The evaluation of the sources is also quite basic. The student does not delve into the provenance of the sources or discuss how the context in which they were produced might affect their utility. For example, they do not consider the fact that Source B was published in a British newspaper during the war, which might have influenced its content and purpose. Similarly, they do not discuss how Source C, being a post-war account by a tank commander, might provide a different perspective.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed analysis and evaluation, including more specific factual knowledge and a consideration of the provenance of the sources. They should also aim to make more explicit links to the question of how useful the sources are to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, including specialist terms like ""alliance system,"" ""Austria-Hungary,"" ""Bosnia,"" ""Serbia,"" ""Russia,"" ""Germany,"" ""Schlieffen plan,"" ""Britain,"" ""France,"" and ""Belgium.""
   - Punctuation is generally accurate, with appropriate use of commas, periods, and quotation marks. However, there is a minor repetition error in the phrase ""that that had led to WWI.""

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall. The sentences are coherent and convey the intended meaning, though there are minor grammatical issues, such as the repetition of ""that"" in the conclusion.
   - The use of conjunctions and prepositions is mostly correct, and the overall structure of the sentences is logical.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately, such as ""alliance system,"" ""annexed,"" ""blank cheque,"" and ""Schlieffen plan.""

Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme:

- **Level 1** requires consistent accuracy in spelling and punctuation, effective control of meaning, and a wide range of specialist terms.
- **Level 2** requires considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, general control of meaning, and a good range of specialist terms.
- **Level 3** requires reasonable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, some control of meaning, and a limited range of specialist terms.

The student's answer demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, general control of meaning, and a good range of specialist terms. While there are minor errors, they do not significantly hinder the overall meaning.

**Final Analysis:**
The student's answer fits well within **Level 2** criteria. Given the forgiving nature of the grading and the overall quality of the response, I would award the higher end of the Level 2 marks.

#### Identification of an Advantage
- **Criteria:** Identification of an advantage.
- **Response:** The answer identifies an advantage: ""the person who starts the business and owns it makes any decisions for the business themselves.""

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The answer identifies a way by stating, ""the business could choose to go online."" This satisfies the first marking criterion as it clearly identifies a way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate. **(1 mark)**

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**

Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer states, ""Financial information can help Lili Heating Ltd as it she requires a loan or overdraft from a bank she can show them her financial forecast."" This outlines a way financial information can help forecast success by facilitating the acquisition of a loan or overdraft. This satisfies the criteria.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**

The link is present but not fully developed.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - The points are linked, but the development is not strong enough to fully satisfy the criteria for 2 marks. The answer does not clearly explain how the financial forecast would help in forecasting the potential success of the business beyond obtaining a loan.

  - Amelia may want to gain more independence after working for someone else for six years (AO2).
  - As a result, she would be determined to succeed as there are very few female business owners in the plumbing industry. This could give her an extra incentive to do well. (AO3a).
  - Therefore, by setting up Lili Heating Ltd she can be her own boss and make her own decisions. She no longer has to carry out repairs on houses for someone else (AO3a).

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer ""convenience"" does not explicitly state one of the four elements of the marketing mix (Product, Place, Promotion, Price). The elements of the marketing mix are typically defined as Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. ""Convenience"" is not one of these elements.
   - **Does the answer satisfy this criterion?** No, the answer does not state one of the elements of the marketing mix.

### Example Answers Comparison

  - This example clearly states ""Place"" as the element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of distributing services to customer homes in Birmingham.
- **Example Answer 2:** ""Promotion methods to attract female customers"" (1)
  - This example clearly states ""Promotion"" as the element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of attracting female customers.
- **Example Answer 3:** ""Product is to repair/install boilers"" (1)
  - This example clearly states ""Product"" as the element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of repairing/installing boilers.

### Marking Notes

- **To award 1 mark there must be evidence of application.**
  - The answer ""convenience"" does not provide evidence of application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd. It does not specify how ""convenience"" relates to the business's marketing mix.

### Conclusion

The answer provides some application of business concepts (AO2) by mentioning that online advertising is free and can reach a wider range of consumers. However, the application is limited and lacks depth, as it does not fully explore the implications or provide detailed context specific to Lili Heating Ltd.

The analysis (AO3a) is basic and does not demonstrate interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning. The candidate mentions that social media is easier and more accessible for people, but this point is not developed further to show how it would specifically benefit Lili Heating Ltd.

The judgement (AO3b) is simple and based on limited evaluation. The candidate concludes that social media advertising is beneficial because it is free and accessible, but this conclusion is not thoroughly justified with a detailed evaluation of the business information and issues relevant to the choice made.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple.

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer states: ""The business is trying to be the cheapest supplier for energy so the quality of the wind turbines could be bad meaning no energy is made.""
   - This statement identifies a potential risk related to the quality of the wind turbines, which could result in no energy being produced. This is a valid risk for investors as it implies that the investment might not yield the expected returns if the turbines fail to produce energy.
   - The context supports this risk as it mentions that Ripple aims to supply energy cheaper than its competitors, which could potentially lead to cost-cutting measures affecting quality.

### Conclusion:
The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple, which is the potential poor quality of wind turbines leading to no energy production. This aligns with the marking criteria and is supported by the context provided.

**Marking Criteria:**

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The candidate states, ""customers are less likely to overpay for energy they don't need."" This is a clear benefit to the customers as it implies cost savings and efficient energy usage. This aligns with the marking criteria of identifying a benefit to customers.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

So if the Government pays to train them it is easier and cheaper for Ripple to hire new employees.

Also, if the business has trained staff, they won't need to try and hire staff without training meaning they won't break any laws in the employment laws, so they won't be fined, meaning they save money and their reputation as a business.

Also if the government pays for training the business can hire more people as they won't have to pay for training making it easier to manage the business and make it less likely that they are understaffed and can't run the business it could be dangerous.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 2 is better for Ripple, providing a clear stance. They justify this by discussing the novelty of renewable energy methods and the potential lack of expertise among new employees, which aligns with the context of Ripple being a green energy company (AO2). This application of knowledge is sound but not detailed, placing it in Level 2.

The candidate then elaborates on the benefits of government-funded training, such as compliance with employment laws and avoiding fines, which demonstrates interconnected points with chains of reasoning (AO3a).

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.

We know this because this was a tactic 'artillery barrage' to manage to get soldiers over no mans land. Additionally, by doing this, it also prevents a stalemate a keeps the war pro-active. At the start of this tactic was massively destroying as the technology of the artillery and the precise aims. At the start the aims wasn't fully correct and was only killing their own men. From here they discovered if they move the artillery by a angle up or down and new technology this tactic was a game changer. We also know that as the shells etc. are dropping the Germans couldn't shoot as they couldn't see. And by the time they had got over no mans land they would jump in the trenches and use there bayonets, and attack/kill german soldiers.","The student identifies relevant features of Source B, such as the use of the 'artillery barrage' tactic to help soldiers advance over no man's land. They explain how this tactic evolved and became more effective over time, which shows some understanding of the content. However, the explanation is somewhat disjointed and lacks clarity. The student does not provide a clear evaluation of the provenance of Source B, which is necessary for higher levels.

There is no mention of Source C in the response, which is required to fully address the question.

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student has made several spelling errors: ""Briton"" should be ""Britain,"" ""Britan"" should be ""Britain,"" and ""tensions"" should be ""tense"" in the context used.
   - Punctuation errors are present, such as missing commas and periods that affect the readability of the text. For example, ""We know that the Triple Alliance and the Entente Alliance did form tension Triple Alliance contained of Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary and the Entente Alliance contained of Briton, France, Russia."" should be split into multiple sentences for clarity.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student demonstrates some control over grammar but makes several errors that affect the overall meaning. For example, ""contained of"" should be ""consisted of,"" and ""Additional towards this made Britan and Germany very much tensions"" is grammatically incorrect and unclear.
   - Despite these errors, the overall meaning can still be understood, though it requires some effort from the reader.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses some specialist terms such as ""Triple Alliance,"" ""Entente Alliance,"" ""Germany,"" ""Italy,"" ""Austria-Hungary,"" ""Britain,"" ""France,"" ""Russia,"" ""WW1,"" and ""Serbia.""
   - However, the range of specialist terms is not particularly wide, and the usage is somewhat repetitive.

Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme:

- **Level 1** requires consistent accuracy in spelling and punctuation, effective control of grammar, and a wide range of specialist terms. The student's answer does not meet these criteria due to multiple spelling and punctuation errors and some grammatical issues.
- **Level 2** requires considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, general control of grammar, and a good range of specialist terms. The student's answer partially meets these criteria but falls short in terms of accuracy and control.
- **Level 3** requires reasonable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, some control of grammar, and a limited range of specialist terms. The student's answer fits this level as it shows reasonable accuracy and some control of grammar, despite the errors, and uses a limited range of specialist terms.

Considering the forgiving nature of the grading and the effort to place the student in a higher level where possible, the student's answer should be awarded:

  - 3",,You get independence and more money to yourself because the amount of money isn't shared.,"This question requires the candidate to 'Explain one advantage'. The candidate has suggested an advantage through 'You get independence and more money to yourself because the amount of money isn't shared'. However, the explanation is not fully developed and lacks clarity. Let's break down the response according to the marking criteria:

- **Identification of an advantage**: The candidate identifies an advantage by stating 'You get independence and more money to yourself'. This is somewhat vague but can be interpreted as an advantage related to financial benefits and control. However, it does not clearly align with the specific advantages listed in the mark scheme, such as limited liability or the ability to sell shares. Therefore, this part is partially fulfilled but not clearly aligned with the mark scheme examples. **(0.5 marks)**

- **Explanation of the identified advantage**: The candidate attempts to explain the advantage by stating 'because the amount of money isn't shared'. This explanation is not clear and does not adequately explain how this advantage is specific to a private limited company. The mark scheme expects a clear explanation, such as limited liability protecting personal assets or the ability to raise finance through selling shares. The candidate's explanation lacks this depth and specificity. **(0 marks)**

Overall, the candidate's response is vague and does not clearly identify or explain an advantage of starting a business as a private limited company in a way that aligns with the mark scheme.

The candidate's response needs to identify a way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate and provide an explanation for it.

**Marking Criteria:**

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The candidate states, ""it might not come up on google maps or safari,"" which implies that the business's visibility on the internet could affect its location choice. However, this is not a clear identification of a way the internet affects the location choice. The mark scheme examples focus on e-commerce, the need for a physical location, or internet connectivity, none of which are directly addressed here. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate explains, ""so you can't travel there,"" which suggests that if a business is not visible online, customers may not be able to find it. However, this explanation is not well-developed and does not align with the mark scheme's examples, such as using e-commerce to avoid needing a physical location or requiring good internet connections for communication. The explanation lacks depth and clarity. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

**Example Answers Comparison:**

### Marking Criteria:
1. **Substitution into correct formula**:
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per unit} - \text{Variable Costs per unit}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of decrease**:
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

- **Mark Awarded:** 1 mark.

#### Explanation of the way:
- **Criteria:** Explanation of how the identified way helps the business become more competitive.
- **Evaluation:** The answer attempts to explain by adding, ""so it can compete and increase customers."" However, this explanation is vague and lacks depth. It does not clearly articulate how competing with local businesses will lead to increased competitiveness or customer base.

### Justification:
- The answer identifies a way a small business could become more competitive, which satisfies the first marking criterion.
- The explanation provided is insufficient and lacks detail. It does not clearly explain the mechanism by which competing with local businesses will lead to increased competitiveness or customer acquisition, thus failing to meet the second marking criterion.

The candidate's response needs to identify a disadvantage and then explain it in detail. Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

### Marking Criteria Evaluation:

- **Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark**
  - The candidate does not clearly identify a specific disadvantage related to not paying employees on time. Instead, they discuss a potential cause of financial difficulty (""not enough customers coming in and buying things"") and its impact on the business's ability to pay employees. This does not directly address the disadvantage to the business of not paying employees on time.
  - **Does not satisfy the criteria.**

- **Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks**
  - The candidate explains that the business might struggle to pay employees due to insufficient profit (""so the business won't make enough profit so it will be hard paying them back if they haven't got as much money consumed""). However, this explanation is more about the cause of the problem rather than the disadvantage itself.
  - The response does not explain the consequences of not paying employees on time, such as decreased employee motivation, increased turnover, or higher recruitment costs.
  - **Does not satisfy the criteria.**

### Example Answers Comparison:
- The example answers clearly identify a disadvantage (e.g., employees wanting to leave, decreased motivation) and then explain the consequences (e.g., increased recruitment costs, problems meeting customer orders). The candidate's response does not follow this structure and lacks a clear identification and explanation of a specific disadvantage.

### Examiner Commentary:
- The candidate's response does not meet the requirements of the marking criteria. They fail to identify a specific disadvantage of not paying employees on time and do not provide a detailed explanation of the consequences. The response focuses more on the cause of financial difficulties rather than the impact on the business and its employees.

- **Explaining the advantage:**

This shows an understanding of the potential positive impact of adapting products, but the explanation lacks depth and detailed reasoning.

The candidate then discusses a potential drawback: ""taking a risk with selling them because nobody might want to buy them,"" which is linked to ""spending money to make the product"" and ""if nobody buys it means you will lose a lot of money."" This demonstrates an understanding of the risks involved but again lacks detailed interconnected points and logical chains of reasoning.

Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The points in the answer are not linked. The response lacks any development or explanation of how financial information could help forecast success. It simply states the purpose without providing any linked points or development.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - Since the points are not linked and there is no development, the response can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark. However, even for 1 mark, the answer should at least provide a basic point, which this response fails to do.

She should also post it on social media because she can earn money from it by just posting photos or videos and it getting a lot of likes and follows. And when it becomes bigger eventually it can go on tv adverts. If she chooses to offer a discounted price to female customers, she will only attract female customers and not many male ones and she won't share it on any social medias for it to get noticed and eventually will run out of female customers and have nobody to go to and can't get paid. So that's why she should go with option 2.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 2 is the best choice for Lili Heating Ltd. They provide some reasoning for this choice, mentioning the visibility and growth potential through social media. However, the application of business concepts and understanding (AO2) is limited and lacks depth. The candidate does not provide detailed contextual information about Lili Heating Ltd or the specific benefits of using social media for this business.

The analysis (AO3a) is basic and lacks interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning. The candidate mentions that social media can help the business grow and attract both male and female customers, but this is not developed with detailed reasoning or evidence. The mention of earning money from social media posts is not directly relevant to the core business of plumbing and lacks a clear connection to the business context.

The evaluation (AO3b) is present but simplistic. The candidate concludes that Option 2 is better because it avoids the limitation of attracting only female customers. However, this judgement is based on a limited evaluation of the business information and issues. The candidate does not thoroughly evaluate the potential benefits and drawbacks of each option in the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

Overall, the answer demonstrates limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts, with basic analysis and a simple judgement. This places the answer in Level 1.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).

    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source A doesn't show you much but it shows that you can be betrayed by the people you trust the most. However, Source B shows soldiers coming from the sea but being hidden from artillery, blowing up in front of them. This acts as a defense if they let the bomb blow more forward and carry that on then the explosion will keep them cover. ","The student's response demonstrates a basic understanding of the sources but lacks depth and accuracy. The analysis of Source A is incorrect as it does not relate to the context of the First World War or military technology and tactics. The analysis of Source B is also flawed, as it misinterprets the image and does not provide a clear explanation of its relevance to military tactics.

To improve, the student should focus on the correct context and content of the sources. For example, Source B shows British soldiers advancing under an artillery barrage, which was a tactic used to protect advancing troops. Source C describes the use of tanks, specifically the 'Whippets,' during the German Spring Offensive, highlighting the development and effectiveness of new military technology.

Overall, the response falls into Level 1 due to the basic analysis and incorrect interpretation of the sources.

Therefore the business making more revenue and income.","This question requires the candidate to 'Explain one way'. The candidate has suggested a way through 'A business might be set up in a location with good views'. This is developed through 'this attracts more people it use it on the internet with more people increases the likelihood of them buying into that business'. The candidate then further develops their answer with 'Therefore the business making more revenue and income'. 

Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of a way (1 mark)**:
  - The candidate identifies a way: 'A business might be set up in a location with good views'. This is a valid point, although it is not directly related to the internet affecting the location choice. The mark scheme examples focus on e-commerce and internet connectivity, but the candidate's point about attracting more people through good views can be considered a valid interpretation. Award 1 mark.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks)**:
  - The candidate explains that 'this attracts more people it use it on the internet with more people increases the likelihood of them buying into that business'. This explanation is somewhat unclear and does not directly link to how the internet affects the location choice. The candidate seems to be mixing the concept of physical attractiveness with internet usage, which is not clearly articulated.
  - The further development 'Therefore the business making more revenue and income' is an attempt to explain the benefit but does not clearly tie back to the internet's role in location choice. The explanation lacks clarity and coherence in linking the internet to the location decision.

Given the lack of clear linkage to the internet's role in affecting the location choice, the explanation does not fully satisfy the criteria for the additional marks.

Overall, the answer should be awarded 1 mark for identifying a way, but no additional marks for the explanation due to lack of clarity and coherence.

  - The internet will not provide focused information to let Amelia know if there will be enough demand for her plumbing and building services (AO2).
  - Although she knows how many females live in Birmingham, it would be difficult to find out how many of them own a property or would want a female plumber to work in their homes (AO3a).
  - Lili Heating Ltd will be in competition against other established plumbers. Amelia will need to spend more time developing her target market to make sure there are enough potential customers (AO3a).

Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families.

Satisfied customers mean customer will give her better reviews and will attract more customers into the business so she increases sales and revenue.","The candidate's response identifies an impact of using secondary market research, stating that it ensures Amelia knows ""what work needs to be done and how much they need to be paid."" This is a relevant point but lacks depth and specific context related to Lili Heating Ltd. The response continues with ""they ensure the know about jobs people do, need doing in the home,"" which is somewhat vague and not clearly linked to the use of the internet for secondary market research.

The candidate attempts to develop the point by stating that knowing how much to charge will lead to profit and satisfied customers, which in turn will lead to better reviews and more customers. However, the logical connections between these points are weak and not fully developed. The response lacks detailed interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning.

In terms of application (AO2), the response includes some context, such as ""knowing how much to charge"" and ""satisfied customers,"" but it is not detailed or specific to the business context of Lili Heating Ltd. The response does not fully address the specific challenges and benefits of using the internet for secondary market research in the context of Amelia's plumbing business.

Overall, the response demonstrates limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues to the business context (AO2) and attempts to deconstruct business information and/or issues, finding limited connections between points (AO3a).

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer states ""quality - the thing she can provide good quality to customers.""
   - **Evaluation:** The term ""quality"" is not one of the four traditional elements of the marketing mix (Product, Price, Place, Promotion). Therefore, this does not satisfy the criteria of stating one element of the marketing mix.

### Example Answers Comparison

- **Example Answer 1:** ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham.""
  - This clearly identifies ""Place"" as an element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.
- **Example Answer 2:** ""Promotion methods to attract female customers.""
  - This clearly identifies ""Promotion"" as an element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.
- **Example Answer 3:** ""Product is to repair/install boilers.""
  - This clearly identifies ""Product"" as an element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

### Marking Notes

- **Application Evidence:** The answer must show evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd. The provided answer does not clearly apply ""quality"" to the context of Lili Heating Ltd in terms of the marketing mix elements.

- The answer does not successfully state one of the four elements of the marketing mix (Product, Price, Place, Promotion).

Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","I choose option 2 - using social media to promote business is free promotions and more people online will be attracted towards it and then buy into the business. Amelia will have more money to grow her business and can also increase revenue, also social media can reach out to more customers that might not be reached through other forms of advertisement. This ensures she's reaching out to as many people as possible and gain more sales from the customers this leads to increase revenue. Offering a discount price to female customers can reach out to more women however she's not attracting everyone like she would if she uses social media to increase revenue. Furthermore only offering discounts to females might cause conflicts and lead to bad reviews, this can decrease sales and revenue.","The candidate begins by stating that they choose Option 2, which is using social media to promote the business. They provide a clear justification for this choice, highlighting that social media promotion is free and can attract a larger audience, leading to increased revenue. This demonstrates a sound application of business concepts and understanding of the business context (AO2). 

The candidate also discusses the potential drawbacks of Option 1, which involves offering discounts to female customers. They argue that this approach might not attract as wide an audience as social media promotion and could lead to conflicts and bad reviews, which could decrease sales and revenue.

  - 1","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",Investing in Ripple is a risk because you don't know how much energy you'll get off the wind farm.,"Let's evaluate the provided answer against the marking criteria and the context.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer states, ""Investing in Ripple is a risk because you don't know how much energy you'll get off the wind farm.""
   - This statement identifies a risk related to the uncertainty of energy supply, which aligns with the marking criteria of stating a risk for investors.

### Example Answers Comparison

- **Loss of money invested in the wind farm (1):**
  - The provided answer does not directly mention the loss of money but focuses on the uncertainty of energy supply.
  
- **Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs (1):**
  - The provided answer closely matches this example. It states, ""you don't know how much energy you'll get off the wind farm,"" which implies that investors may not receive enough energy.

- **Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy (1):**
  - The provided answer does not address the potential failure of the business due to lack of demand.

### Marking Notes

- **To award 1 mark there must be evidence of application:**
  - The answer applies the context of Ripple's business model, which involves supplying energy based on investment. The risk mentioned is directly related to the uncertainty of energy supply, which is a valid concern for investors.

### Conclusion

The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple by stating the uncertainty of energy supply. This aligns with the marking criteria and matches one of the example answers provided in the mark scheme.

  - 2","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","They let Ripple know how much energy they need, this makes sure they are not spending too much money on what they don't need and are satisfied.","**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer states, ""this makes sure they are not spending too much money on what they don't need and are satisfied."" This indicates a benefit to customers by ensuring they do not overspend, which aligns with the marking criteria. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer provides linked development by explaining that identifying energy needs ensures customers ""are not spending too much money on what they don't need and are satisfied."" This shows a clear link between asking questions and the benefit to customers. However, the answer lacks specific evidence of application to Ripple's context, such as mentioning the creation of a green energy plan or the investment in the wind farm. Therefore, this criterion is partially satisfied.

**Marks Awarded:**
- The answer provides a valid benefit and linked development but lacks specific contextual evidence. According to the mark scheme, this would result in a maximum of 1 mark for points not fully linked with evidence of application.

    - As Ripple grows it will need to employ new people in line with the government target of 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector. As these are new jobs there will be a need for training to develop new skills. (AO2).
    - If Ripple pays less tax to the government then it would have more retained profit to invest into the business. This could result in cheaper energy being provided to its members. As a result, Ripple may attract more investment and could then expand into other green business ideas (AO3a).

    - Students can progress to this level by demonstrating thorough and detailed understanding with logically connected reasoning and clear justifications.
  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

Also paying less tax means they can use this money instead to advertise, this leads to more customers and ripple gets more sales. This increases revenue and makes ripple more successful. Option 2 by providing free training of businesses recruit new employees means ripple will be more likely to get more employees however this won't increase the sales that's why I picked option 1. No extra sales means ripple won't increase revenue and profit and can suffer if they don't have enough customers.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 1 is the best choice for Ripple, providing a clear stance. They justify this by explaining that reduced tax payments would allow Ripple to focus on growth and potentially increase income and job creation, which aligns with AO2. The candidate also mentions that the saved money could be used for advertising, leading to more customers and increased sales, which is a logical chain of reasoning (AO3a).

However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed interconnected points. The candidate does not fully explore the implications of reduced tax payments or provide a thorough evaluation of how this would impact Ripple's success in the long term. The mention of Option 2 is brief and dismissive, without a detailed comparison or evaluation of its potential benefits.

The answer demonstrates a basic understanding of business concepts and makes some connections between points, but these are not fully developed or detailed. The evaluation is limited and does not provide a thorough justification based on a detailed analysis of the business information and issues.

Ripple’s marketing mix offers quality a lower prices compared to its competitors this can mean people want to buy into them compared to competition. This means ripple will lose out on money per customer but will gain more customer so that they can decrease in revenue per customer but increase total revenue. Furthermore by offering a lower price, ripple will be more successful. Ripple customers invest into ripple and save money on energy costs in these homes, it costs the customers alot but in the long run they'll save money and even though it's alot customers are better off investing in ripple becaise its a 'cheaper alternative'. And they ensure ripple makes profit while the customer save money and reduce costs keeping them satisfied and ripple making more money.","The candidate begins by mentioning the components of the marketing mix, but the explanation is somewhat unclear and lacks depth. The response does touch on the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix by stating that Ripple offers lower prices compared to its competitors, which could attract more customers. This demonstrates some understanding of the business concept (AO1b).

In terms of application (AO2), the candidate references Ripple's strategy of offering lower prices and the potential for increased customer acquisition. However, the explanation is not detailed and lacks specific references to the context provided, such as the unique consumer-owned wind farm model or the green energy aspect.

The analysis (AO3a) is limited, with the candidate making some connections between lower prices and increased customer base but not fully developing these points. The reasoning is somewhat disjointed and lacks logical consistency.

The evaluation (AO3b) is minimal, with a simple assertion that Ripple will be more successful by offering lower prices. The conclusion is not well-supported by a thorough evaluation of the business information and issues.

Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In my opinion, in Source B and Source C to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War they wouldn't really understand how but if they get told what they were doing and how they was doing it, they would understand it. In Source B you can see lots of aircraft and there is soldiers all in a line and there is lines coming through the air to show where the explosives are going to land and they land a few meters in front of the soldiers and that's because when the explosive goes off it will create smoke and make it hard for the enemys to see so they have time to run and fire and in source C it talks about a soldier getting stuck in his tank and the Germans were gonna going to attack him but then more soldiers came in bigger and better tanks with soldiers behind and destroyed the Germans.","The student provides a basic analysis of both sources, identifying some relevant features. For Source B, they mention the presence of aircraft, soldiers in a line, and the use of artillery to create smoke for cover. For Source C, they describe the situation of a soldier stuck in a tank and the arrival of newer tanks to counter the German threat. However, the analysis lacks depth and does not include any contextual knowledge or detailed evaluation of the content and provenance of the sources.

To improve, the student needs to provide more specific factual knowledge and explain how these features are useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War. They should also evaluate the provenance of the sources, considering aspects such as the date of publication, the author's background, and the purpose of the sources.

There is the Wall Street crash and that was a big reason for WWI to start because both didn't agree on the same thing and they both had different opinions.,"Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's assess the student's answer for Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG).

### Analysis:

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are some issues with punctuation. For example, the sentence ""There is the Wall Street crash and that was a big reason for WWI to start because both didn't agree on the same thing and they both had different opinions."" is a run-on sentence and could be punctuated better for clarity.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student uses grammar with some control of meaning, but there are areas where the meaning is not entirely clear. For instance, the phrase ""both didn't agree on the same thing"" is somewhat vague and could be more specific.
   - The use of ""WWI"" instead of ""the First World War"" is acceptable, but the explanation lacks depth and clarity.

3. **Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses the term ""Wall Street crash,"" which is a specialist term, but it is not directly related to the causes of the First World War. This indicates a limited range of appropriate specialist terms.

### Conclusion:

Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme:

- The student spells and punctuates with reasonable accuracy.
- The student uses rules of grammar with some control of meaning, and any errors do not significantly hinder meaning overall.
- The student uses a limited range of specialist terms as appropriate.

Based on this analysis, the student's answer fits best within **Level 3**.

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer does not clearly identify an advantage of starting a business as a private limited company. The statement ""You get to be your own boss"" is more relevant to being self-employed or starting a business in general, rather than specifically addressing the advantages of a private limited company. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**
  - Since the answer does not correctly identify an advantage specific to a private limited company, it also fails to provide an explanation of such an advantage. The explanation provided, ""which means you can pick your own times and you don’t have to,"" is incomplete and does not relate to the context of a private limited company.

The candidate has suggested a way through ""A business would need to use the internet because it can get popular from media..."" and this is developed through ""...people would only want to go to a place with wifi/internet services."" However, the explanation lacks depth and clarity. Let's break down the response according to the marking criteria:

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The candidate identifies a way by stating, ""A business would need to use the internet because it can get popular from media."" This is a valid point, although it is not directly related to the location choice. The mark scheme example mentions choosing a cheaper location or needing good internet connections, which are more directly related to location choice. The candidate's point about popularity from media is somewhat tangential.
  - **Mark: 0** (The identification is not directly related to the location choice as per the mark scheme examples.)

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate attempts to explain by stating, ""...people would only want to go to a place with wifi/internet services."" This explanation is somewhat relevant but lacks depth and clarity. It does not fully explain how the internet affects the choice of location for a small business.
  - The mark scheme examples provide clear explanations, such as using e-commerce to avoid needing a physical retail location or needing good internet connections for communication. The candidate's explanation does not reach this level of clarity or relevance.
  - **Mark: 0** (The explanation is not sufficiently developed or directly relevant to the location choice.)

Overall, the candidate's response does not fully satisfy the criteria set out in the mark scheme. The identification of the way is not directly related to the location choice, and the explanation lacks depth and clarity.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B and C are useful because source B shows how the British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage and source C shows how tanks were used in war. This information would benefit somebody studying this topic as it shows diagrams of essential tech in the military. Both of sources and B and C have different military vehicles. The tank which was being explained by a tank commander in World War one, Frank Mitchell. Frank notices how quickly these damages were made by the quote ""They quickly destroyed the German threat"". Source B however portrays plane and aerial threats showing people running whilst there are dotted lines showing where the bombs will be placed.  ","The student identifies basic features of both sources, such as the use of artillery in Source B and tanks in Source C. They also mention the provenance of Source C, noting that it was written by a tank commander, Frank Mitchell, which adds some credibility to the account. However, the analysis is quite basic and lacks depth. The student does not provide much contextual knowledge or detailed evaluation of the sources' utility.

To improve, the student could have included more specific details about the context of the First World War, such as the significance of the German Spring Offensive or the development of new military tactics and technology. They could also have evaluated the provenance of Source B more thoroughly, considering its publication date and purpose.

Let's break down the mark scheme and compare it with the student's answer:

1. **Substitution into correct formula**:
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Costs per Unit}}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of decrease in break-even level of output**:
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}

Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.",Better equipment and more workers,"The answer provided is ""Better equipment and more workers.""

Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria and example answers provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria:

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success.**
  - The answer does not outline a way financial information could help forecast success. Instead, it mentions ""better equipment and more workers,"" which are potential uses of financial resources but not directly related to how financial information helps forecast success.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks.**
  - The points in the answer are not linked. The response does not explain how ""better equipment and more workers"" are connected to financial information in a business plan or how they help forecast success.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark.**
  - Since the points are not linked and do not directly address how financial information helps forecast success, the response does not meet the criteria for more than 1 mark.

### Example Answers:

- **Example Answer 1:** ""The business plan could contain a cash-flow forecast for Lili Heating Ltd (1). This would help ensure there was always enough cash to pay for plumbing supplies (1).""
  - This example clearly outlines how a cash-flow forecast, a piece of financial information, helps ensure there is enough cash for supplies, directly linking financial information to business success.

- **Example Answer 2:** ""A break even forecast could be included in the business plan (1). This would set a target of how many female customers were needed to start making a profit (1).""
  - This example outlines how a break-even forecast helps set targets for profitability, directly linking financial information to business success.

### Marking Notes:

- **To award 2 marks, there must be linked development and evidence of application.**
  - The provided answer lacks linked development and does not show evidence of application to the context of Amelia's business plan.

### Conclusion:

The answer ""Better equipment and more workers"" does not meet the criteria for outlining how financial information in a business plan could help forecast success. It does not provide linked points or evidence of application. Therefore, the response should be awarded 0 marks.

This all caused chaos within Europe which later involved Balkans such as Serbia and Bosnia this is why I strongly think alliances and Europe caused World War one. 
","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's assess the student's answer for Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG):

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors:
     - ""has"" should be ""had"" in ""countries in the Triple Entente has fierce rivalry.""
     - ""Alliance system"" should be ""Alliance systems"" or ""The Alliance system"" for subject-verb agreement.
     - ""World War one"" should be ""World War One"" or ""World War I"" for proper noun capitalization.
   - Punctuation errors include:
     - Missing commas for clarity, e.g., ""This all caused chaos within Europe, which later involved Balkans such as Serbia and Bosnia.""
     - The sentence ""Italy fled very quickly from the whole war in general just to later switch sides to the Triple Entente."" could be clearer with better punctuation.

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student generally uses grammar correctly but with some errors:
     - ""These Alliance system caused more countries to get involved with conflict across Europe and between both alliances."" should be ""This Alliance system caused more countries to get involved in conflicts across Europe and between both alliances.""
     - ""This all caused chaos within Europe which later involved Balkans such as Serbia and Bosnia"" should be ""This all caused chaos within Europe, which later involved the Balkans, such as Serbia and Bosnia.""
   - Despite these errors, the overall meaning is clear.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses some specialist terms appropriately, such as ""Triple Entente,"" ""Triple Alliance,"" and ""Balkans.""
   - However, the range of specialist terms is somewhat limited.

Given the criteria:

- **Level 1:** Consistent accuracy in spelling and punctuation, effective control of grammar, and a wide range of specialist terms.
- **Level 2:** Considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, general control of grammar, and a good range of specialist terms.
- **Level 3:** Reasonable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, some control of grammar, and a limited range of specialist terms.

The student's answer shows reasonable accuracy in spelling and punctuation with some errors, general control of grammar with some errors that do not significantly hinder meaning, and a limited range of specialist terms.

**Final Analysis:**
The student's answer fits best in **Level 3** due to the reasonable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, some control of grammar, and limited use of specialist terms. However, considering the forgiving nature of the grading, the student demonstrates a good effort and the errors do not severely hinder the overall meaning.

    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

    - Response does not address the question","Source A:  A British cartoon entitled ‘Betrayed’, published in December 1917. The figure in
the doorway is the German Kaiser.","In Source A, the Bolsheviks are portrayed as two-faced as they betrayed Russia for German gold. As we know the Germans and the Russians signed a treaty and gave up land to not fight each other if anything happens since they were weak however, Kaiser Wilhelm II soon broke this treaty and was know to the Russians as a liar and the russians were betrayed. Source A is also critical of the Bolsheviks during the First World war, as there were tensions between Russia and Germany. Germany then formed an alliance with Italy and Austria-Hungary which was known as the Triple Alliance. The same time later Russia joined England and France to form the Triple Entente.","The student identifies relevant features of the source, such as the portrayal of the Bolsheviks as two-faced and the betrayal of Russia for German gold. They also bring in some factual knowledge about the treaty between Germany and Russia, although there are inaccuracies in the details provided. The student mentions the Triple Alliance and the Triple Entente, but these points are not directly linked to the source or the question about the Bolsheviks' actions during the First World War.

The analysis is somewhat disjointed and lacks a clear focus on how the source is critical of the Bolsheviks. The student does not fully develop the reasoning or link the content of the source to the contextual knowledge in a coherent manner.

To reach Level 2, the student would need to provide a more developed analysis, clearly linking the features of the source to the contextual knowledge and explaining how these features demonstrate criticism of the Bolsheviks. For example, they could mention how the cartoon shows the Bolsheviks dragging Russia towards Germany, indicating betrayal, and link this to the historical context of the Bolshevik Revolution and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B and C are both useful to historians studying military tactics in the first world war, since both sources portray an image about the warfare of war. Source B is a picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. Source B shows the reader how the British advanced under a military barrage. Source B shows and portrays to the reader how the British studied what to do under a military barrage. As you can see all the soldiers are running to the right trying to predict where the bullets land. Furthermore, the historian is trying to study tactics in the first world war. In Source B we know the newspaper was a British published piece and in the picture we don't see any injured and dead British soldiers, this is to keep the moral and the urge to fight in their heart as well as the people in the factories making bullets, explosives, etc. In source c, we have an extract from the book Tank Warfare; the story of The Tank in the Great war by Frank Mitchell published after the war. Source c is helpful to the reader historian studying tactics and military technology as Frank Mitchell fought in the war and was a tank commander and describes being in the battle German spring offensive in April 1918. Source C is helpful to a historian studying Military technology as Mitchell was nearly killed in his tank however when he looked on his right he saw '7 of our newest and fastest tanks (whippets), firing machine guns, the drove straight into germans and destroyed the threat' this is helpfull because the historian can replicate and study what happend in the Spring offensive war in April 1918. ","The student demonstrates an understanding of both sources and provides some analysis of their content. For Source B, the student identifies that it shows British soldiers advancing under an artillery barrage and suggests that the image was used to maintain morale. For Source C, the student notes that it is an account from a tank commander describing the use of new tanks during the German Spring Offensive.

However, the evaluation of the sources is somewhat basic and lacks depth. The student does not provide much contextual knowledge to support their analysis, nor do they fully explore the provenance of the sources. The analysis of Source B could be improved by discussing the significance of the date (October 1917) and the context of the war at that time. Similarly, the analysis of Source C could be enhanced by providing more information about the German Spring Offensive and the development of tank warfare during the First World War.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed evaluation of both the content and provenance of the sources, supported by contextual knowledge. They should also aim to make more explicit links to the usefulness of the sources for a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.

The Germans wanted to wipe out the French and move on to Russia thinking the Russian Army would be underprepared however they were preparing for war a long time ago. As the Germans were attacking the French, they managed to get to Verdun which was heavily protected by French, British sent troops to Verdun to release pressure of the French making more time for Russians. This led to a problem for Germany as they were fighting a war on two fronts and Russia joining so their plan failed hugely. ","The student provides a basic overview of the Schlieffen Plan and its intended objectives, which moves the answer beyond level 0. The answer is presented in a structured account, demonstrating specific knowledge and understanding relevant to the question, such as the German strategy to capture France and then move on to Russia. This places the answer in level 2.

However, the analysis of causation/consequence is quite simple. The student mentions that the plan failed because Germany ended up fighting a war on two fronts, but this point is not developed with detailed factual knowledge or a clear explanation of how this led to problems in 1914. The answer lacks the depth and range of accurate knowledge required for higher levels.

Also I think the Moroccan and Balkan crises played a part in the build up to war.","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, let's assess the student's answer for Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG):

1. **Spelling and Punctuation:**
   - The student spells all words correctly.
   - There are some punctuation issues:
     - The sentence ""I agree mostly and disagree, why?"" should be punctuated differently for clarity, such as ""I agree mostly and disagree. Why?""
     - The sentence ""because the Germans sparked tension in Europe since they formed an alliance between Germans, Italy and Austria-Hungary so the British, French and Russians formed an alliance known as the Triple Entente."" is a run-on sentence and could be improved with better punctuation, such as breaking it into two sentences: ""because the Germans sparked tension in Europe since they formed an alliance between Germany, Italy, and Austria-Hungary. As a result, the British, French, and Russians formed an alliance known as the Triple Entente.""
     - The final sentence ""Also I think the Moroccan and Balkan crises played a part in the build up to war."" is missing a comma after ""Also.""

2. **Grammar:**
   - The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are some areas where control of meaning could be improved:
     - The phrase ""I agree mostly and disagree"" is somewhat awkward and could be clearer.
     - The use of ""because"" at the beginning of the sentence without a preceding main clause is grammatically incorrect.

3. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses several specialist terms appropriately, such as ""Germans,"" ""Italy,"" ""Austria-Hungary,"" ""Triple Entente,"" ""Moroccan and Balkan crises.""

Given the criteria:

- **Level 1:** Consistent accuracy in spelling and punctuation, effective control of meaning, wide range of specialist terms.
- **Level 2:** Considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, general control of meaning, good range of specialist terms.
- **Level 3:** Reasonable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, some control of meaning, limited range of specialist terms.

The student's answer shows considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, though not consistent. The grammar shows general control of meaning, though not always effective. The use of specialist terms is good.

**Final Analysis:**
The student's answer fits best in **Level 2** due to considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, general control of meaning, and a good range of specialist terms.

  - 3",,one advantage of a starting a business as plc is that you can choose what you want to do with it,"**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer does not successfully identify an advantage of starting a business as a private limited company (PLC). The statement ""you can choose what you want to do with it"" is too vague and does not align with the specific advantages listed in the mark scheme, such as limited liability or the ability to sell shares to raise finance. Therefore, no mark can be awarded for this criterion.

- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**
  - Since the answer does not identify a clear advantage, it also fails to provide an explanation of the identified advantage. The explanation provided (""you can choose what you want to do with it"") does not elaborate on any specific benefit related to the structure of a private limited company. Therefore, no marks can be awarded for this criterion.

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The candidate identifies a way by stating, ""it shows amount of people in the area and shows what those people like."" This is a valid point as it suggests that the internet can provide demographic and preference data about a location. This satisfies the identification criterion. **(1 mark)**

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate attempts to explain the way by mentioning, ""Survey so the business knows what to sell."" However, this explanation is not fully developed and does not clearly link to how the internet affects the choice of location. The explanation lacks depth and does not sufficiently elaborate on the initial point. According to the mark scheme, a more developed explanation is required to earn the additional marks.

1. **Substitution into correct formula**:
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per unit} - \text{Variable Costs per unit}}
     \]
   - The fixed costs are £10,000, the new selling price is £6.50 per unit, and the variable costs are £2.50 per unit.
   - Substituting these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output**:
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}

**Marking Criteria:**

- **Identification of a way:**
  - The candidate states, ""If business could become more competitive if they sell the same product/similar as well doing what the customers want."" This is a vague identification of a way. It suggests selling similar products and meeting customer demands but lacks clarity.
  - According to the mark scheme, a clear identification of a way is required, such as ""charging lower prices"" or ""improving the quality of the product."" The candidate's response does not clearly identify a specific way.
  - **Does not satisfy the criteria.**

- **Explanation of the way:**
  - The candidate does not provide a clear explanation of how selling similar products or doing what customers want would make the business more competitive. There is no development of the idea or explanation of the mechanism by which this would improve competitiveness.
  - The mark scheme requires an explanation, such as ""This would mean customers are more likely to buy the product because it is cheaper than other products"" or ""This would attract customers because they think they are getting a better product.""
  - **Does not satisfy the criteria.**

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provide a clear identification of a way and a detailed explanation of how it would work. For instance, ""A small business could gain an advantage by charging lower prices (1).

The candidate has identified an advantage but has not provided a detailed explanation. Let's evaluate the answer against the marking criteria:

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate states, ""if it meets its legal obligations, this would make the business more successful."" This identifies an advantage, albeit in a very general sense. According to the mark scheme, an advantage such as ""A small business would not get sued for breaking the law"" is more specific. However, the candidate's response does identify an advantage, so it should be awarded 1 mark.

- **Explanation of the advantage:**
  - The candidate does not provide a clear explanation of how meeting legal obligations would make the business more successful. The mark scheme expects an explanation such as ""This means the business would not have to face financial consequences such as a fine"" or ""This will prevent the business from having a negative image."" The candidate's answer lacks this level of detail and does not explain the mechanism by which meeting legal obligations leads to success. Therefore, no marks can be awarded for the explanation.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation:

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The candidate does not clearly identify an advantage of using retained profit as a source of finance. The statement ""It would start them off as an actually business for the company"" is vague and does not directly relate to the advantages listed in the mark scheme, such as being a cheap source of finance or not paying interest. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

- **Explaining the advantage:**
  - The candidate does not provide an explanation of the advantage. The statement lacks clarity and does not explain how retained profit benefits the business. There is no development of the idea or linkage to the context of retained profit. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

### Example Answers Comparison:
- The example answers provide clear identification and explanation of advantages, such as ""Retained profit is a cheap source of finance"" and ""Interest is not paid on retained profit,"" followed by explanations like ""The business would not experience an increase in costs"" and ""The owner(s) keep full control of all decisions made since no new shares are issued."" The candidate's response does not align with these examples in terms of clarity and relevance.

### Conclusion:
- The candidate's response does not meet any of the marking criteria. It neither identifies a clear advantage nor provides an explanation.

Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria:

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success.**
  - The answer does not mention any specific financial information such as cash-flow forecasts, break-even analysis, or any other financial metrics that could help forecast success. Therefore, it does not satisfy this criterion.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks.**
  - The answer does not provide linked points. It mentions that the business is new and people might know about it, but it does not link this to any financial information or how it would help forecast success. Therefore, it does not satisfy this criterion.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark.**
  - The points are not linked, and the response does not provide any relevant financial information. Therefore, it does not satisfy this criterion either.

**Example Answers for Reference:**
- ""The business plan could contain a cash-flow forecast for Lili Heating Ltd (1). This would help ensure there was always enough cash to pay for plumbing supplies (1).""

### Answer Provided:
- Cash in flow year 3,203
- Outflow = £132,000
- Balance £48,000

### Evaluation:
1. **Substitution into correct formula:**

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer ""Choice"" does not clearly state one of the elements of the marketing mix (Product, Place, Promotion, or Price). The term ""Choice"" is vague and does not directly correspond to any of the four Ps of the marketing mix.
   - According to the Mark Scheme, acceptable answers should clearly identify one of the elements, such as ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham,"" ""Promotion methods to attract female customers,"" or ""Product is to repair/install boilers.""
   - Therefore, the answer does not satisfy this criterion.

### Marking Notes Evaluation

- **To award 1 mark there must be evidence of application.**
  - The answer ""Choice"" does not provide any evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd. It does not mention any specific aspect of the business or how it relates to the marketing mix.
  - The context provided about Amelia Cooper and her business Lili Heating Ltd. does not support the term ""Choice"" as an element of the marketing mix.

### Conclusion

Based on the evaluation, the answer ""Choice"" does not meet the criteria for stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd. and does not provide any evidence of application. Therefore, no marks should be awarded.

  - 1","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",financial lost,"Let's evaluate the given answer ""financial lost"" against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer ""financial lost"" does indicate a potential risk for investors, which is the loss of money. This aligns with the example answer ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm (1)"" provided in the mark scheme.
   - However, the phrasing ""financial lost"" is grammatically incorrect. The correct term should be ""financial loss."" Despite this, the intent of the answer is clear and it does identify a risk.

### Evidence of Application

- The answer does not explicitly reference the context provided, but it implicitly aligns with the risk of losing money invested in Ripple's wind farm. The context mentions that customers invest money into the wind farm and are supplied with energy based on their investment. If the business fails or does not perform as expected, investors could indeed face financial loss.

### Conclusion

- The answer ""financial lost"" does fulfill the marking criteria by identifying a risk for investors, which is the potential loss of money. Despite the grammatical error, the intent is clear and aligns with the example answer provided in the mark scheme.

### Marks Awarded

- Based on the evaluation, the answer should be awarded 1 mark as it successfully states a risk for investors in Ripple, which is the potential financial loss.

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer does not clearly identify an advantage of starting a business as a private limited company. The statement ""makes it easier to earn money"" is vague and does not directly relate to the specific advantages listed in the mark scheme, such as limited liability or the ability to sell shares to raise finance. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**
  - The explanation provided, ""because you're not paying anyone,"" is unclear and does not logically follow from the initial statement. It does not explain how starting a business as a private limited company leads to the advantage mentioned. The mark scheme examples provide clear explanations, such as limited liability protecting personal possessions or raising finance through selling shares. This criterion is also not satisfied.

**Overall Assessment:**
- The answer does not meet the criteria for identifying and explaining an advantage of starting a business as a private limited company. The response is vague and lacks the necessary detail and clarity to be awarded any marks.

  - 3",,If there's bad WiFi it makes it harder for small business to promote the business.,"This question requires the candidate to 'Explain one way'. The candidate has suggested a way through ""If there's bad WiFi it makes it harder for small business to promote the business."" Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation:

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The candidate identifies a way by stating ""If there's bad WiFi."" This is a valid identification of a way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate. 
  - **Mark: 1**

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate attempts to explain the way by stating ""it makes it harder for small business to promote the business."" This explanation is somewhat relevant but lacks depth and clarity. It does not fully develop the idea of how bad WiFi impacts the business's location choice.
  - The explanation could be improved by detailing how poor WiFi affects communication with stakeholders or the ability to use e-commerce, as suggested in the example answers.
  - **Mark: 0**

### Example Answers Comparison:
- The example answers provide a more detailed explanation, such as ""The business could choose a cheaper location because the business can use e-commerce"" or ""A location with a weak signal could cause barriers to communication for the business."" The candidate's answer does not reach this level of detail.

racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.

The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy.

    - As Ripple grows it will need to employ new people in line with the government target of 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector. As these are new jobs there will be a need for training to develop new skills. (AO2).
    - If Ripple pays less tax to the government then it would have more retained profit to invest into the business. This could result in cheaper energy being provided to its members. As a result, Ripple may attract more investment and could then expand into other green business ideas (AO3a).

  progression:
    - Students can progress to this level by demonstrating thorough and detailed understanding with logically connected reasoning and clear justifications.
  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

The candidate's response needs to identify a way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate and provide an explanation of this way.

**Marking Criteria:**

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The candidate does not clearly identify a specific way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate. The response mentions ""having more competition"" and ""shutting down the stores,"" but these points are not directly related to the location decision influenced by the internet. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The candidate's explanation is vague and does not clearly link the internet to the location decision. The response states, ""it could lead to shutting down the stores because of its income in the business,"" but this does not explain how the internet specifically affects the choice of location. The explanation lacks clarity and does not provide a logical connection to the internet's impact on location decisions. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

**Example Answers for Reference:**
- ""The business could choose a cheaper location (1)""
- ""This is because the business can use e-commerce (1)""
- ""As a result, the business may not require a physical retail location (1)""
- ""The business will need to be in a location with good internet connections (1)""

   - Substituting these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

Now, let's compare this with the given Answer:

- The given Answer is: 
  \[
  4000/0.50 = 615.3 \quad \text{(incorrect formula and calculation)}
  \]
  \[
  615.3 \text{ units} \quad \text{(incorrect result)}
  \]

The given Answer does not show the correct substitution into the formula, nor does it provide the correct final answer. Therefore, it does not meet any of the criteria outlined in the Mark Scheme.

#### Identification of an Advantage
- **Criteria**: Identification of an advantage.
- **Response**: The answer does not clearly identify a specific advantage. The statement ""It would meet its legal obligations by having the consumer rights Act"" is more about compliance rather than an advantage.
- **Mark Awarded**: 0 marks. The candidate does not explicitly identify an advantage.

#### Explanation of the Advantage
- **Criteria**: Explanation of the advantage.
- **Response**: The explanation provided is vague and lacks clarity. The candidate states, ""this could lead to better company and also having a better business,"" but does not explain how meeting legal obligations leads to these outcomes.
- **Mark Awarded**: 0 marks. The explanation is not sufficiently developed to show how meeting legal obligations results in a better company or business.

### Overall Marks
- **Total Marks Awarded**: 0 marks. The answer does not meet the criteria for identifying and explaining an advantage of meeting legal obligations.

### Justification
- The candidate's response does not clearly identify an advantage of meeting legal obligations, as required by the mark scheme.
- The explanation provided is too vague and does not sufficiently develop the point to show a clear link between meeting legal obligations and the stated benefits.
- According to the mark scheme, valid points must be clearly identified and explained, which is not achieved in this response.

#### Identification of a disadvantage: 1 mark
- The answer identifies a disadvantage: ""that they employees might want to work somwhere else."" This satisfies the first marking criterion as it clearly states a potential negative outcome of not paying employees on time.

#### Explanation of the disadvantage: up to 2 further marks
- The answer attempts to explain the disadvantage by stating, ""this could lead to the business shutting down."" This is a valid point but lacks a clear connection to the initial disadvantage identified. The explanation is somewhat vague and does not fully develop the idea.
- The answer further states, ""it would affect the owner because he is not paying them on time."" This statement is not a clear explanation of the disadvantage to the business but rather a restatement of the problem. It does not add to the understanding of the consequences of not paying employees on time.

### Example Answers Comparison
- The example answers provide a clear chain of reasoning, such as employees wanting to leave leading to increased recruitment costs or decreased motivation leading to lower productivity and problems meeting customer orders. The given answer does not provide such a clear and logical progression.

- **Explaining the advantage:**
  - The explanation provided is vague and lacks clarity. The phrase ""this could lead to a better payment system and also have the profit come back in the business"" does not clearly explain how retained profit is advantageous. It does not align with the example answers provided in the mark scheme, such as ""Retained profit is a cheap source of finance"" or ""Interest is not paid on retained profit.""

Let's evaluate this response against the marking criteria:

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer does not outline a specific way financial information could help forecast success. Instead, it mentions ""having more research in the market,"" which is not directly related to financial information. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The answer does not provide linked points. It only mentions ""having more research in the market"" without further development or linkage to financial information. Thus, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **If points are not linked, award a maximum of 1 mark:**
  - The answer does not provide any valid point related to financial information in a business plan. It focuses on market research, which is not the same as financial forecasting. Therefore, even for unlinked points, this criterion is not satisfied.

Given the marking notes and the example answers, the response does not meet the requirements for any marks. The example answers clearly show that the response should include specific financial tools like cash-flow forecasts or break-even analysis, which are not mentioned in the provided answer.

The reference to ""advertising products"" is also not clearly tied to the context or the non-financial aims of starting her own business.

- **Application of Knowledge and Understanding (AO2):** The response shows limited application of business concepts to the context. The candidate does not effectively link Amelia's non-financial aims to her decision to start Lili Heating Ltd. The context provided in the question is not utilized effectively.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer states, ""she should be able to promote her products.""
   - This statement identifies ""promotion"" as an element of the marketing mix, which is one of the four Ps (Product, Price, Place, Promotion).
   - **Criteria Met:** Yes, the answer successfully states one element of the marketing mix, which is ""promotion.""

### Application to Context

2. **Evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer does not explicitly mention Lili Heating Ltd or provide specific details related to the context of Amelia's business.
   - The mark scheme requires evidence of application to award the mark. The example answers provided in the mark scheme show specific application to the business context, such as ""Promotion methods to attract female customers.""
   - **Criteria Met:** No, the answer lacks specific application to Lili Heating Ltd. It does not mention any promotional methods or strategies that Amelia might use for her business.

### Conclusion

- The answer correctly identifies ""promotion"" as an element of the marketing mix, which satisfies the first marking criterion.
- However, it fails to provide evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd, which is necessary to award the mark according to the marking notes.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy.

  - 2","Ripple is an energy company aimed at providing green and renewable energy to homes and businesses across the UK. It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",They might want to primary research to adapt is costermer needs.,"**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer does not clearly state a benefit to customers of Ripple. The phrase ""They might want to primary research to adapt is costermer needs"" is vague and does not directly address a specific benefit to the customers. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Award up to 2 marks for linked points outlining a benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer does not provide linked points outlining a benefit to customers. It mentions ""primary research"" and ""customer needs,"" but these points are not linked in a coherent manner that outlines a specific benefit. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Award a maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The points in the answer are not linked. The response is disjointed and does not clearly outline a benefit to customers. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **To award 2 marks there must be linked development and evidence of application:**
  - There is no linked development or evidence of application in the answer. The response does not provide a clear, developed point that is relevant to the context of Ripple. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

However, I also think that it would be a small business This means that it would be harder to reduce the amount of tax This would lead to harder to reduce tax prices.

In conclusion, I think that it would be a good decision to reduce tax by a small business. This means that it would be more better to reduce it.
","The candidate's response is fragmented and lacks coherence. The answer does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the business concepts and issues relevant to Ripple. 

- **Application of Knowledge (AO2):** The candidate makes a vague reference to tax cuts and renewable energy but fails to apply this knowledge effectively to the context of Ripple. The mention of ""letting out renewable wave"" and ""solar energy"" is not clearly connected to the options provided in the question. This places the response in Level 1 for AO2.

- **Deconstruction of Business Information (AO3a):** The candidate attempts to deconstruct the issue but does so with limited connections between points. The reasoning is unclear and lacks logical consistency. The statement ""it would be harder to reduce the amount of tax"" is not well-explained or connected to the context of Ripple. This places the response in Level 1 for AO3a.

- **Judgement and Justification (AO3b):** The candidate makes a simple judgement in the conclusion but provides a limited and unclear justification. The conclusion that ""it would be more better to reduce it"" is not supported by a thorough evaluation of the business information and issues. This places the response in Level 1 for AO3b.

The answer does not directly address the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix. Instead, it discusses various unrelated aspects such as carbon emissions, wind turbines, and solar energy without clear connections to the question.

- **Knowledge and Understanding (AO1b):** The response demonstrates very limited knowledge and understanding of business concepts. The terminology used is vague and often incorrect.

- **Application (AO2):** There is minimal application of knowledge to the business context. The candidate fails to relate their points to Ripple's specific situation or the importance of price in its marketing mix.

- **Analysis (AO3a):** The response attempts to deconstruct business information but fails to find meaningful connections between points. The points made are disjointed and lack logical reasoning. This places the response in Level 1.

- **Evaluation (AO3b):** The conclusion is weak and unsupported by the preceding discussion.

#### Identification of a way (1 mark)
- The answer does not clearly identify a specific way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate. The response mentions ""People on social media may have certain interests depending on the area,"" but this is not a direct identification of a way the internet affects location choice. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

#### Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks)
- The explanation provided is somewhat vague and does not directly link to how the internet affects the location choice of a small business. The response states, ""A business may see a rise in trend of their own ideas in a certain area. This may influence them to move towards that area as social media acts as marketing and your business is actively meeting customer needs."" This could be interpreted as an attempt to explain how social media trends might influence location decisions, but it lacks clarity and directness.
- The response does not clearly explain how the internet (or social media) directly impacts the decision to choose a specific location. The mention of ""ensuring sales, reducing risk of failure and revenue"" is too general and does not provide a clear link to the location decision.

### Conclusion
- The answer does not meet the criteria for identification of a way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate.
- The explanation provided is vague and does not clearly link to the impact of the internet on location choice.

  - The challenge of setting up a plumbing business in Birmingham, where competition is high, could be a driving force for Amelia (AO2).
  - Amelia may want to gain more independence after working for someone else for six years (AO2).
  - As a result, she would be determined to succeed as there are very few female business owners in the plumbing industry. This could give her an extra incentive to do well. (AO3a).
  - Therefore, by setting up Lili Heating Ltd she can be her own boss and make her own decisions. She no longer has to carry out repairs on houses for someone else (AO3a).

Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","She has started it to offer convenience to women who may feel uncomfortable this would offer personal satisfaction, this would make her more inclined to work and has given her a unique selling point, they collectively can improve sales and customer satisfaction increasing sales and brand awareness encouraging more customers to use her services stimulating growth. However this may lead to her putting other aims as less important which means that the business will lack in other areas like success and market shares, this can increase risk and decrease brand reputation if the business is lacking success. However she also has aims to increase brand awareness by encouraging customers to spread the good service,this inclines customers to buy her service and spread again increasing brand awareness and revenue reducing risk of failure.","The candidate's response identifies a non-financial aim, ""offer convenience to women who may feel uncomfortable,"" and links it to personal satisfaction and a unique selling point. This is developed through the idea that it can improve sales and customer satisfaction, leading to increased sales and brand awareness, which in turn encourages more customers and stimulates growth. This chain of reasoning is logical and interconnected, meeting the criteria for Level 3 in terms of analysis (AO3a).

However, the response also mentions potential negative impacts, such as putting other aims as less important, which could lead to a lack of success and market share, increasing risk and decreasing brand reputation. This shows an understanding of the broader implications of focusing on non-financial aims, adding depth to the analysis.

In terms of application (AO2), the response is contextualized with references to ""women who may feel uncomfortable,"" ""unique selling point,"" and ""brand awareness."" These references are relevant to Amelia's situation and demonstrate a detailed application of business concepts to the context.

This is developed through the idea that there could be hidden factors not accounted for, leading to inaccurate data.

","Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer states: ""Convenience as she would relate to her target audience: women, showing that they are more comfortable and entitled with her.""
   - **Evaluation**: The answer does not clearly state one of the traditional elements of the marketing mix (Product, Place, Promotion, or People). Instead, it mentions ""Convenience,"" which is not one of the four Ps of the marketing mix. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

### Example Answers Comparison

- **Example Answer 1**: ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham.""
  - This clearly identifies ""Place"" as an element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.
- **Example Answer 2**: ""Promotion methods to attract female customers.""
  - This clearly identifies ""Promotion"" as an element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.
- **Example Answer 3**: ""Product is to repair/install boilers.""
  - This clearly identifies ""Product"" as an element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

### Marking Notes

- **Application Evidence**: The answer must show evidence of application to Lili Heating Ltd. The given answer does mention the target audience (women) and how they would feel more comfortable, but it does not clearly link this to one of the elements of the marketing mix.

### Conclusion

The answer does not fulfill the marking criteria as it does not clearly state one of the elements of the marketing mix (Product, Place, Promotion, or People). Therefore, no marks can be awarded.

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer states, ""The government would want the business to be successful as they would pay more tax if they are making large sums of profit."" This outlines a reason why the government would want the business to be successful, which aligns with the marking criteria. Therefore, this criterion is satisfied.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The answer provides a linked point by explaining that ""the more profit made the higher taxation is on it."" This development links the initial point about paying more tax to the concept of higher profits leading to higher taxes. Thus, the points are linked, satisfying this criterion.

- **Example Answers:**
  - The answer aligns with the example answer, ""The government will collect more tax if Lili Heating Ltd is successful,"" and provides further development by explaining the relationship between profit and taxation. This supports awarding full marks.

However, Option 2 will include anybody this can be a selling point of inclusiveness, social media will also increase brand reputation and awareness making people know about your business. Social media followers will make customers inclined to purchase the service offering a loyal customer base increasing brand reputation. Despite this is may also be time consuming to post and answer social media this can take time from generating new ideas and other aspects of the business like freedom and independence which can decrease security and personal satisfaction bringing more hassle.
Despite this, option one cuts of half of potential customers males will be less likely to pay especially if they see they have to pay more than others meaning the business has a large cut in sales reducing choice of pucos and increasing risk of failure. Overall option 2 offers anybody to be included and will start a loyal customer base reducing risk of losing market share.","The candidate begins by discussing Option 1, highlighting its potential to influence the target market and generate more sales due to the unique selling point of reduced prices. This demonstrates some application of business concepts to the context of Lili Heating Ltd (AO2). However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed interconnected points, which limits it to Level 1.

The candidate then moves on to discuss Option 2, mentioning the benefits of inclusiveness and the potential for increased brand reputation and awareness through social media. This part of the answer shows a better understanding of business concepts and provides some interconnected points, although there are logical inconsistencies and a lack of thorough evaluation (AO3a). The mention of the time-consuming nature of social media management is a valid point but is not fully developed.

The candidate concludes by comparing the two options, noting that Option 1 might alienate male customers, which could reduce sales. This shows an attempt at evaluation (AO3b), but the judgement is not well-supported by thorough analysis or detailed reasoning.

Overall, the answer demonstrates limited application and understanding of business concepts with some attempts at analysis and evaluation. The response fits best within Level 1, as it lacks the depth and interconnected points required for higher levels.

","Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria and the context provided.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

#### Criteria: Stating one risk for investors in Ripple

- **Evaluation**: The answer states, ""If equipment is damaged invester is liable as its their part of land, maintenance will be expensive."" This statement identifies a risk related to the potential damage of equipment and the associated maintenance costs, which investors would be liable for. This is a valid risk for investors in Ripple.

### Example Answers Comparison

- **Example Answer 1**: ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm (1)""
  - **Comparison**: The given answer similarly addresses a financial risk, though it focuses on maintenance costs rather than a direct loss of investment.
  
- **Example Answer 2**: ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs (1)""
  - **Comparison**: The given answer does not address energy supply but rather the financial liability for equipment damage.
  
- **Example Answer 3**: ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy (1)""
  - **Comparison**: The given answer does not address business failure but rather the financial implications of equipment damage.

### Marking Notes Application

- **Application Evidence**: The answer must show evidence of application to the context of Ripple. The answer mentions ""equipment"" and ""maintenance,"" which are relevant to the operation of a wind farm. However, it does not explicitly mention Ripple or the wind farm, which weakens the application to the specific context.

### Final Marking Decision

- **Total Marks**: 1

- **Awarded Marks**: 1

- **Rationale**: The answer successfully identifies a risk for investors, which is the financial liability for equipment damage and maintenance costs. This is a valid risk in the context of investing in a wind farm. Although the answer could be more explicitly tied to Ripple, it sufficiently meets the criteria for stating a risk.

### Conclusion

The answer should be awarded 1 mark as it fulfills the marking criteria by identifying a valid risk for investors in Ripple, despite the lack of explicit mention of Ripple or the wind farm.",0,1,1,,,FALSE,,,,,,,6.803893089,"{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 660, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.0033, 'completion_tokens': 442, 'completion_cost': 0.00663, 'total_cost': 0.00993}","{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 480, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.0024, 'completion_tokens': 1, 'completion_cost': 1.5e-05, 'total_cost': 0.0024149999999999996}"

","**Response/Examiner Commentary:**

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer does mention a benefit to customers, which is the ""variety of choice for the customers to make it personal to their preference."" This aligns with the marking criteria of identifying a benefit to customers. However, the benefit is not clearly linked to the context of Ripple asking questions to identify customer needs.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer attempts to develop the point by stating that this variety of choice means ""they are more likely to be bought as it is the customers choice what to choose increasing revenue."" However, this development is more focused on the business's revenue rather than the direct benefit to the customer. The context of Ripple asking questions to identify customer needs is not explicitly mentioned or linked to the benefit described.

- **Contextualization:**
  - The answer lacks specific contextualization related to Ripple's process of asking questions to identify customer needs and how this directly benefits the customers. The context provided in the question mentions that Ripple asks questions to create a green energy plan tailored to each customer's needs, but this is not reflected in the answer.

**Overall Assessment:**
- The answer identifies a potential benefit to customers but does not sufficiently link it to the context of Ripple asking questions to identify customer needs. The development is more focused on the business's revenue rather than the customer's benefit, and there is a lack of specific contextualization.

**Marks Awarded:**
- Based on the marking criteria and the provided context, the answer should be awarded 1 mark for identifying a benefit to customers but not providing linked development and evidence of application.

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

Ripple sell also they can reduce prices with this inclining more people to purchase it increasing sales leading to more revenue and less risk of failure. But will end once successful leading to a sudden drop in profit redicing level of success nad consilla. However option 2 means less money and time of the business is spent on employees this means that there is less fixed costs in the business meaning there is a much higher margin of safety if the business breaks even this reduces risk and can increase financial success. However this also means the business has to recruit new employees meaning that they have to spend more time finding suitable employes and pay their salary while training so the workers are not affecting the business until training is over this can reduce output as more employees havent started yet and reduces time for the owner leading to less sales and more stress for the owner as he has more to deal with increasing risk of failure. Overall option one offers less flaws and large benefits to a small business but once successful will no longer be in use wheras 2 will be useful as long as the business operates
","The candidate begins by discussing the impact of reduced tax on Ripple, highlighting that retained profits can be reinvested to reduce costs and increase efficiency. This demonstrates some application of business concepts (AO2) and attempts to deconstruct business information (AO3a). However, the explanation is somewhat fragmented and lacks detailed interconnected points. The candidate also mentions the potential for increased sales and reduced risk of failure, but this is not fully developed.

The candidate then considers the second option, which involves less money and time spent on employees. They discuss the potential benefits of reduced fixed costs and a higher margin of safety, but again, the explanation is somewhat disjointed and lacks depth. The candidate also mentions the challenges of recruiting and training new employees, which could reduce output and increase stress for the owner, but this is not fully explored.

The conclusion attempts to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of both options, but it is not clearly justified or based on a thorough evaluation of the business information and issues (AO3b). The overall response demonstrates a basic understanding of business concepts and makes some connections between points, but it lacks the detailed application and logical chains of reasoning required for higher levels.

It also crosses price as the investor may see some return on investment from excess energy or extra value from supplying them this means that although prices may be expensive this may not be an issue as investors may still purchase it increasing security and decreasing risk. They also claim that its cheaper than investors this gives them the upper hand over other businesses who may charge more this means they may not earn as much but have investors generating income for them regularly reducing risk of failure. However, Ripple sell you the land with the generators which still cost a lot this would put of many as the price may not serve value to the customers who may not have a business this can decrease chance of survival and may make the service obsolete as it may only benefit large businesses reducing sales. They also require maintenance and depend on weather this presents a lot of risk and extra payments that the consumer are finding will not want to purchase the service as it cause issues for them, this reduces sales and potential loyal customers. Overall Apple doesn't really focus on price as it sees success in large investors who see profit in it and people who care about sustainability, they can also sell energy generated that they own which eliminates risk and necessity to reduce and focus on price as much as others like a USP of convenience to customers.
","The candidate begins by discussing Ripple's unique selling point (USP) of sustainability and its convenience for investors, which is relevant to the question. They mention that investors can gain revenue and energy, which touches on the importance of price indirectly. However, the explanation is somewhat unclear and lacks depth. The candidate then discusses the potential return on investment and the claim that Ripple's energy is cheaper than competitors, which is a valid point related to price. 

In the second paragraph, the candidate highlights the high initial costs and the potential deterrent for customers, which is a relevant consideration of price. They also mention the maintenance costs and dependency on weather, which are valid points but could be more clearly linked to the importance of price in the marketing mix.

The conclusion attempts to summarize the points made but is somewhat vague and lacks a clear, well-reasoned judgment. The candidate states that Ripple does not focus on price as much as other factors, but this point could be better supported with more detailed evaluation.

Overall, the response demonstrates some understanding of business concepts and issues (AO1b) and applies this knowledge to the context of Ripple (AO2). However, the analysis (AO3a) and evaluation (AO3b) are limited and lack depth. The response fits best in Level 2 due to the sound application of knowledge and some interconnected points, but with logical inconsistencies and limited evaluation.

Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.

I know this because you can see them advancing efficiently and with little casualtys. In source C it shows us that Britain was rapidly advancing and was prepared to fight this war. This is useful for a historian because it shows how britain advanced in WW1.,"The student identifies relevant features of both sources, such as the British soldiers advancing under an artillery barrage in Source B and the use of tanks in Source C. However, the analysis is quite basic and lacks depth. The student does not provide detailed factual knowledge or extended reasoning to support their points. The evaluation of the sources is also simplistic, with statements like ""this is useful for a historian because it shows how Britain advanced in WW1"" without further elaboration.

Analysis:
- **Spelling and Punctuation**: The student spells most words correctly but makes some errors, such as ""chliffien"" instead of ""Schlieffen"" and ""country's"" instead of ""countries."" Punctuation is generally accurate, but there are some missing commas that could improve clarity.
- **Grammar**: The student demonstrates general control of grammar, but there are some issues that affect the overall meaning. For example, ""there was many more reasons"" should be ""there were many more reasons,"" and ""a lot of more other country's"" should be ""a lot more other countries.""
- **Specialist Terms**: The student uses some specialist terms like ""Alliance System"" and ""WWI,"" but the range is limited and not always accurate (e.g., ""chliffien plan"").

Given the criteria, the student's performance aligns most closely with Level 2, as they spell and punctuate with considerable accuracy and use grammar with general control of meaning.

- **Identification of an advantage:**
  - The answer identifies an advantage: ""they won't have their ideas copied by other businesses."" This is a valid point, although it is not one of the most common advantages listed in the mark scheme. However, it is acceptable as per the marking notes which state to ""accept any other appropriate response."" Therefore, this criterion is satisfied. **(1 mark)**

- **Explanation of the identified advantage:**
  - The explanation provided is: ""I know this because when a business is private other companies won't be able to use their ideas and products for their own business."" This explanation is somewhat vague and does not fully elaborate on how being a private limited company specifically prevents other businesses from copying ideas. The mark scheme examples provide more detailed explanations, such as limited liability or the ability to raise finance through selling shares. The candidate's explanation lacks depth and does not clearly link to the specific legal protections or operational advantages of a private limited company.

800 units","Based on the provided question, answer, and mark scheme, let's evaluate the given answer step by step.

### Mark Scheme Breakdown:
1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Costs per Unit}}
     \]
   - Substituting the new selling price:
     \[
     \text{New Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of decrease in break-even level of output:**
   - Decrease = Original break-even level - New break-even level
   - Decrease = 4,000 units - 2,500 units = 1,500 units

### Given Answer:
- The given answer is:
  \[
  4000/5=800 \quad \text{(800 units)}
  \]

### Evaluation:
1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The given answer does not show the correct substitution into the formula. Instead, it incorrectly divides the original break-even level by the original selling price, which is not the correct approach.
   - No marks can be awarded for this step.

2. **Calculation of decrease in break-even level of output:**
   - The given answer does not address the decrease in the break-even level of output. It only provides an incorrect calculation of 800 units without any context or correct working.
   - No marks can be awarded for this step.

### Conclusion:
The given answer does not demonstrate any correct working or understanding of the formula required to calculate the decrease in the break-even level of output. Therefore, no marks can be awarded.

Also adapting a already existing product could be time-consuming.","The candidate begins by stating a potential impact, ""they could get more profit from the new products,"" which is a valid point but lacks development. The answer then mentions an advantage, ""they could use the most successful product they already had, and developing it to make it better,"" which aligns with the indicative content about adapting existing products taking less time and creative input. However, this point is not fully developed with logical chains of reasoning.

The candidate also identifies a potential drawback, ""customers might like a change in product so they might not like the product the business spent time to adapt it,"" which aligns with the indicative content about less innovative ideas not fully meeting changing customer needs. This point is somewhat developed but lacks detailed interconnected points.

Finally, the candidate mentions, ""adapting an already existing product could be time-consuming,"" which contradicts the indicative content that suggests adapting existing products can take less time. This indicates some logical inconsistency.

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**
  - The answer states, ""she can find out if she needs an overdraft to forecast the potential success in her business."" This outlines a way financial information can help forecast success, as it mentions the need for an overdraft, which is a financial consideration.

- **Points must be linked to award up to 2 marks:**
  - The points in the answer are not sufficiently linked. The statement ""she can find out if she needs an overdraft"" is not clearly connected to how this helps forecast the potential success of the business. The answer lacks development and does not explain the relationship between needing an overdraft and forecasting success.

1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The correct formula to calculate the closing balance is:
     \[
     \text{Closing balance} = \text{Opening balance} + (\text{Cash inflows} - \text{Cash outflows})
     \]
   - The correct substitution should be:

   - The Answer provided does not show this correct substitution. Instead, it incorrectly calculates:
     \[

   - Therefore, no mark can be awarded for correct substitution.

2. **Final Answer:**
   - The correct final answer should be:

### Marking Criteria:
1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer states: ""One element of the marketing mix could be place and where she is located at.""
   - This statement identifies ""place"" as an element of the marketing mix, which is correct according to the mark scheme. The example answer in the mark scheme mentions ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham,"" which aligns with the concept of ""place"" in the marketing mix.
   - However, the answer lacks specific application to Lili Heating Ltd. The context mentions that Amelia's business will operate in the Birmingham area, but the answer does not explicitly connect ""place"" to this context. To fully satisfy the criteria, the answer should have included a specific reference to distributing services in Birmingham or a similar application.

### Conclusion:
- The answer correctly identifies ""place"" as an element of the marketing mix, but it does not fully apply this to the context of Lili Heating Ltd. as required by the marking notes.

  example_answer: 
    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","I think she should choose option 2 because if she promotes her business on social media people might see her advertisement and share it around to other people. It also means she doesn’t have to give any discount price out to her female customers so she can possibly get more money. 
However, there could be a possibility that option 1 makes her business more successful than option 2 because people might not like to try anything new as it could cause problems. Therefore, people might not go and ask her for Lili even if they see her advertisement and promotion on social media.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 2 should be chosen, providing a basic justification that social media promotion could lead to wider visibility and sharing among potential customers. This demonstrates some application of business concepts (AO2), but it is limited and lacks depth. The candidate also mentions that not offering discounts could result in higher revenue, which is a relevant point but not fully developed.

In the second paragraph, the candidate acknowledges the potential benefits of Option 1, suggesting that discounts might attract more customers who are hesitant to try new services. However, this point is not fully explored or connected to the business context, showing limited analysis (AO3a).

The final judgement is simple and lacks thorough evaluation, as it does not weigh the pros and cons of each option in detail. The candidate's reasoning is basic and does not provide a clear, justified conclusion based on a thorough evaluation of the business information and issues (AO3b).

Overall, the answer demonstrates limited understanding and application of business concepts, with basic analysis and a simple judgement. This places the answer in Level 1.

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",An example of a risk for an investor is that they could pay money to Ripple and not get anything or not get the amount they need.,"Let's evaluate the given Answer against the Mark Scheme criteria:

### Marking Criteria:
- **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple**

### Evaluation:

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The Answer states, ""An example of a risk for an investor is that they could pay money to Ripple and not get anything or not get the amount they need.""
   - This statement identifies a potential risk for investors, which is the possibility of not receiving the expected return on their investment or not getting the required amount of energy. This aligns with the example answer in the Mark Scheme: ""Investors may not receive enough energy for home/business needs (1).""
   - The Answer is directly related to the context provided, where Ripple supplies energy based on the amount of money invested by the customers. If the energy supplied does not meet the customers' needs, it represents a clear risk.

### Conclusion:
- The Answer successfully identifies a risk for investors in Ripple, fulfilling the criteria in the Mark Scheme.

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer states, ""their business could supply the customers with how much energy they need because they will know by asking them questions."" This indicates a benefit to customers as it implies that Ripple will be able to tailor the energy supply to meet the specific needs of each customer. This aligns with the marking criteria of identifying a benefit to customers.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The response does not provide linked development or specific evidence of application. The answer mentions that Ripple will know how much energy customers need by asking questions, but it does not develop this point further or provide specific context from the provided information about Ripple. For example, it could have mentioned that this tailored approach ensures customers receive the correct green energy plan or the correct amount of energy for their needs, as seen in the example answers.

Given the marking criteria and the example answers, the response identifies a benefit but lacks linked development and specific application to the context of Ripple. Therefore, the response should be awarded 1 mark.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

The answer does not demonstrate a clear understanding of the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix. The candidate mentions that customers need to pay before receiving energy, but this point is not developed or linked to the broader context of Ripple's business model or the competitive environment.

**Level and Mark Assignment:**

1. **Knowledge and Understanding (AO1b):**
   - The response demonstrates very limited knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues. The terminology used is minimal and not specific to the context of Ripple's marketing mix.
   - **Level 1** is appropriate here.

2. **Application (AO2):**
   - There is a very limited application of knowledge to the business context. The response does not effectively apply the concept of price to Ripple's specific situation or explain how it fits into their marketing mix.
   - **Level 1** is appropriate here.

3. **Analysis (AO3a):**
   - The response does not deconstruct business information or issues. There are no interconnected points or chains of reasoning provided.
   - **Level 0** is appropriate here.

4. **Evaluation (AO3b):**
   - The response does not make a judgement or provide any justification based on evaluation of business information and issues.
   - **Level 0** is appropriate here.

**Overall Level and Mark:**
- The response fits best in **Level 1** due to the limited knowledge and application demonstrated.
- Given the minimal content and lack of depth, the response should be awarded **1 mark**.

**Examiner Commentary:**

the doorway is the German Kaiser.","Source A is very critical of the Bolsheviks during the First World War, because in Source A it shows a man wearing a hat with Bolsheviks written on it trying to take some thing of a girl with a hat that says Russia. This infers that whoever made this cartoon believes that the Bolsheviks are just taking and taking from Russia. Also in the cartoon, we can see a man who depicts Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany stood behind a curtain and rubbing his fists together. Demonstrating that the Bolsheviks worked for Germany and the Kaiser was their boss.","The student identifies relevant features of the source, such as the man with the hat labeled ""Bolsheviks"" and the girl with the hat labeled ""Russia."" They explain the meaning of these features, suggesting that the Bolsheviks are taking from Russia. The student also identifies the figure of Kaiser Wilhelm II and explains his presence as indicating that the Bolsheviks were working for Germany. 

However, the analysis lacks depth and does not include extended reasoning supported by factual knowledge and understanding. There is no mention of the historical context, such as the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 or the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918, which would provide a more developed analysis.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Sources B and C are helpful to historians studying military technology and tactics. For example, in Source B it shows us how the British army planned to use an artillery barrage (or more commonly known as a 'creeping barrage') in battles. This source is helpful because it shows historians how Britain planned to end the stalemate and push the German troops back, even further. Source B also helps the reader see the progress in terms of how military tactics improved. Source B is quite helpful because it shows historians how the 'creeping barrages' were supposed to work, we know that this wasn't the case and the first few times it was used, it ended up with many British troops being killed by their own. 

Source C is helpful to historians because it gives them a first hand account of what it was like being in a tank during a battle. This source is also very credible because it was written by a soldier, who was in the battle and recieved a medal for bravery in that battle.

Source C is helpful to historians because it gives them an idea of how the soldiers felt during battle and how greatful they were about the newest tanks, 'whippets', coming and helping them from being attacked by the germans. ","The student demonstrates a basic understanding of both sources and provides some analysis of their content. For Source B, the student identifies the use of the artillery barrage and explains its significance in military tactics, mentioning the concept of the 'creeping barrage'. They also touch on the historical context by noting that the initial use of this tactic resulted in friendly fire incidents. However, the evaluation of the source's utility is not fully developed, and there is no mention of the provenance of the source, which is necessary for higher-level responses.

For Source C, the student recognizes the value of a first-hand account from a tank commander and mentions the credibility of the source due to the author's direct experience and bravery award. They also highlight the introduction of the 'Whippet' tanks and their impact on the battlefield. However, the analysis lacks depth, and there is no detailed evaluation of the content or provenance.

To reach a higher level, the student needs to provide more detailed factual knowledge, explicitly link the content and provenance to the sources' utility, and offer a more complex evaluation of how these sources contribute to understanding military technology and tactics during the First World War.

Britain and France pushed Germany back to the Hindenburg Line and then many German soldiers went to go and invade Russia, however, Germany weren't prepared for how quick Russia re-armed.

","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, here is the analysis of the student's answer:

### Spelling, Punctuation, and Grammar (SPaG) Analysis:

1. **Spelling:**
   - The student spells most words correctly, including specialist terms like ""Austro-Hungarian,"" ""Balkan,"" ""archduke,"" ""Franz Ferdinand,"" ""Black Hand,"" and ""Serbian.""
   - There are minor errors such as ""World war one"" instead of ""World War One"" and ""germany"" instead of ""Germany.""

2. **Punctuation:**
   - The student uses punctuation marks such as commas and periods, but there are some run-on sentences and missing capitalizations (e.g., ""germany,"" ""russia,"" ""france,"" ""britain"").
   - The use of quotation marks around 'Black Hand' is correct.

3. **Grammar:**
   - The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are some issues with sentence structure and run-on sentences.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by

Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a

Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","The British soldiers advanced under a artillery barrage in the summer of 1917. This image demonstrates the tactics used during WW1, where artillery bombardments were often used to soften enemy defenses before infantry advances. The artillery barrage was a crucial component of French warfare during this period, but this could also be propaganda to showcase British military strength and resilience during WW1. The soldiers were depicted as brave and determined despite facing heavy enemy fire.  ","The student identifies relevant features of Source B, such as the use of artillery barrages and infantry advances, and explains their significance in the context of WW1 tactics. However, the analysis is somewhat basic and lacks depth. The student mentions the possibility of propaganda but does not develop this point or provide additional factual knowledge to support the evaluation. There is no mention of Source C, which is necessary to fully address the question.

To improve, the student should include a more detailed evaluation of Source B, considering both content and provenance, and then analyze Source C in a similar manner. Additionally, the student should provide more contextual knowledge and explicitly link the sources to their utility for a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.

  example_answer: []",,"The Schlieffen Plan was a military strategy developed by the German Empire before WWI. It aimed to quickly defeat France in the west and then focus on Russia in the east. However, the plan had several weaknesses that led to problems in 1914. One key issue was the violation of Belgian neutrality. Germany's invasion of Belgium to execute the Schlieffen Plan brought the UK into the war. As they were committed to protecting Belgian neutrality. This decision significantly expanded the conflict beyond what Germany anticipated. additionally, the Schlieffen Plan relied heavily on precise timing and movement of troops. any delays or miscalculations in the execution of the plan could mess up the plan. This became evident during the Battle of the Marne when German advance had halted, forcing them to retreat. The failure to achieve a quick victory in France undermined the core principle of the Schlieffen Plan, leading to a prolonged and costly war on the Western front furthermore, the plan underestimated the resilience and determination of the allied forces. the french and british armies put up a strong defence slowing down the German advances. The inability to swiftly defeat France g impeded by the Schlieffen plan's failure to deliver a swift victory in France. the violation of Belgium, and the resiliency of the the allied forces all contributed to the problems faced in 1916. these factors ultimately led to a protracted and devastating conflict that diverged significantly from the initial expectations of the german military command.","The student provides a structured account of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, moving beyond basic statements to show a simple analysis of causation and consequence.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","In Source B it shows how artillery was used for cover and creeping barrage. Initially the creeping barrage was not used very well in battles, such as the Somme. It wasnt used well because people didn't know how to fire shells accurately and they would blow up their own soldiers. Source B shows how much more accurate people got firing the artillery shells and by the first world war artillery was being used much more effectively.
Source C tells about how tanks were used in the first world war. Originally tanks weren't used properly or effectively. Tanks were sent out in ones and would be picked off easily by the Germans. Eventually the allies would be sending 100-200 tanks at a time which was much more effective than just the 1.","The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides some basic analysis. For Source B, they explain the use of artillery and the concept of the creeping barrage, mentioning its initial ineffectiveness and subsequent improvement. For Source C, they describe the evolution of tank tactics, from ineffective single tank deployments to more effective mass tank assaults.

However, the analysis lacks depth and specific contextual knowledge. The student does not provide detailed examples or extended reasoning related to the utility of the sources. The evaluation of the provenance is also missing, which is necessary for higher-level responses.

To reach Level 2, the student would need to include more specific factual knowledge and provide a simple evaluation of the content and/or provenance. For example, they could mention the significance of the date of Source B (October 1917) in relation to the development of artillery tactics or discuss the reliability of Source C given that it was written by a tank commander who participated in the events described.

The student does not explain why the image is critical of the Bolsheviks or provide any contextual knowledge about the historical events surrounding the Bolshevik Revolution and Russia's withdrawal from the First World War.

To reach Level 2, the student would need to develop their analysis further by explaining how the image is critical of the Bolsheviks and supporting this with factual knowledge and understanding. For example, they could mention that the cartoon is British and was published in December 1917, shortly after the Bolshevik Revolution, and that Lenin made peace with Germany in 1918, which allowed Germany to concentrate its forces on the Western Front.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```",Source B is an image of soldiers using one of their most commonly used tactic. The way they used this tactic was using cannons for soldiers to jump into then they send another over the top and repeatedly done this until they got to German trenches and went diving in with their bayonets. Source C is about a story of an army soldier who drove a tank in world war and tells us about his story. Him and his tank was stuck and Germans were ready to attack although 7 of the newest army tanks came streaming through spraying their machine guns quickly making Germans vanish because the tank is a metal box of horror.,"The student provides a basic analysis of both sources, identifying relevant features and explaining their significance. For Source B, the student describes the tactic of using artillery to support infantry advances, which is a valid point. For Source C, the student summarizes the account of a tank commander and the effectiveness of the new 'Whippet' tanks in combat.

However, the analysis lacks depth and does not include extended reasoning or detailed factual knowledge. The student does not evaluate the provenance of the sources or explain how the content and provenance make the sources useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War. 

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed contextual knowledge, such as the development and impact of artillery tactics and tank warfare during the war. They would also need to evaluate the reliability and usefulness of the sources based on their provenance, such as the fact that Source B is a newspaper image from 1917 and Source C is a post-war account by a decorated tank commander.

- **Spelling and Punctuation**: The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors such as ""alot"" instead of ""a lot"" and ""would of"" instead of ""would have."" Punctuation is generally accurate, but there are some minor issues, such as the lack of a comma after ""agree"" and before ""but.""
- **Grammar**: The student demonstrates general control of grammar, but there are some errors that affect the clarity of the response.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B shows Britians new tatric called shelling time table. This was used to attrack the enemys and take land. This also helped to stop stalement and create movement from the other side. How this plan would work is for example a cannon shot every 4 minutes going 30 yards forward everytime. The soldiers would then go right behind where the shell is going to explode and the attack opponents that are still alive and also attack the trenches. Source C shows Britians new development in tanks. The British would take 30-40 tanks to battle. Although tanks were extremily expensive they was very useful becouse of the fact they had a turrent which is a gun inside the tank that can easily rotate 360°. Tanks could also fire shells and were hard to destroy. Although Tanks were good at fighting against the opposition enemys they wasnt very fast only be able to go around 34 mites per hour which is a basic walking pace. Tanks become used more by the British and they was continuely being developed becoming quicker and stronger. 
","The student identifies relevant features of both sources and provides some basic analysis. For Source B, they describe the tactic of the ""shelling timetable"" and explain how it was used to advance on enemy positions. For Source C, they describe the development and use of tanks, specifically the ""Whippets,"" and their effectiveness in battle. However, the analysis lacks depth and detailed contextual knowledge. 

The student does not fully evaluate the provenance of the sources or explain how the content and provenance make the sources useful to a historian. There is also a lack of extended reasoning and complex evaluation, which are required for higher levels.

To improve, the student should:
1. Provide more detailed contextual knowledge about the tactics and technology used in the First World War.
2. Evaluate the provenance of the sources, explaining why the fact that Source B is a newspaper picture and Source C is a post-war account by a tank commander makes them useful or limited.
3. Use extended reasoning to explain how the content and provenance of the sources contribute to their utility for a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.

This plan soon came to an end after first invading Belgium but Britain had an alliance with Belgium where if anyone tried to invade them then Britain will start to fight against them. This created tension between Belgium and Germany. Germans then went into France attempting to invade Paris. Germans was around 40 miles away from Paris in the river Marne where a battle was started. The Battle of the Marne was the dangerous battle with the most deaths and most injuries coming out off the Battle of Marne.","The student provides a basic narrative of the Schlieffen Plan and its initial execution, which moves the answer beyond level 0. The answer identifies some key events, such as the invasion of Belgium and the Battle of the Marne, but lacks detailed factual knowledge and understanding. The explanation of how these events led to problems is minimal and lacks depth.

The answer does not demonstrate a structured account or developed analysis of causation/consequence, which is required for level 2. The student mentions the creation of tension between Belgium and Germany and the Battle of the Marne but does not explain the consequences of these events in detail or how they led to further problems in 1914.

To reach level 2, the student would need to provide a more structured account with specific knowledge and understanding, showing a simple analysis of sequencing and supporting it with factual knowledge.

This then caused Austria Hungary to declare war on Serbia but Serbia had recently annexed Bosnia so Bosnia was involved with the Serbia against Austria-Hungary but because of their alliance with Germany that allowed Germany to be involved. France then wanted to fight against the Germans because they were unhappy with the Germans caused from the Moroccan crisis. The Moroccan crisis was when France wanted to invade Morocco but Germany wanted Morocco to stay as an independent country this created tension between the Germans and French. France then joined the war in the balkans. but because of France's alliances with Britian and Russia (called the triple entente) this also meant that Britian and Russia had to join the war. Italy then joined Germany's dual alliance, to now make it the triple alliance. Britian were already upset with the Germans because of the arms race. The arms race created tension between Britian and Germans both attempting to creae the bigger navy with more advanced weapons and more soldiers.","The student begins by addressing the given factor, the Alliance System, and provides a basic explanation of how it led to the involvement of multiple countries in the conflict. They mention the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and the subsequent declaration of war by Austria-Hungary on Serbia, which then involved Germany due to the Triple Alliance. This explanation shows some understanding of the alliances and their impact on the escalation of the conflict.

The student also mentions other factors, such as the Moroccan Crisis and the arms race between Britain and Germany, which contributed to the tensions leading up to the war. However, these explanations are not fully developed and lack detailed factual knowledge and understanding.

### Spelling:
- The student spells most words correctly, but there are a few errors:
  - ""Britian"" should be ""Britain""
  - ""creae"" should be ""create""
  - ""arch duke"" should be ""Archduke""
  - ""Austria-Hungary"" should be consistently hyphenated
  - ""the black hand"" should be ""The Black Hand"" (proper noun)
  - ""Balkans"" should be capitalized consistently

### Punctuation:
- The student uses punctuation with some accuracy, but there are several issues:
  - Missing commas for clarity (e.g., ""Personally, I do believe this statement..."")
  - Inconsistent use of periods and capitalization (e.g., ""France then joined the war in the balkans. but because of France's alliances..."")
  - Incorrect use of apostrophes (e.g., ""France's alliances"" should be ""France’s alliances"")

### Grammar:
- The student generally uses grammar correctly, but there are some errors:
  - Sentence fragments and run-on sentences (e.g., ""France then joined the war in the balkans. but because of France's alliances..."")
  - Some awkward phrasing and lack of clarity in certain parts (e.g., ""but Serbia had recently annexed Bosnia so Bosnia was involved with the Serbia against Austria-Hungary"")

### Specialist Terms:
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately:
  - ""Triple Alliance""
  - ""Archduke Franz Ferdinand""
  - ""The Black Hand""
  - ""Moroccan crisis""
  - ""Triple Entente""
  - ""arms race""

### Final Analysis:
- The student demonstrates considerable accuracy in spelling and punctuation, though there are some errors.
- The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall, despite some awkward phrasing and run-on sentences.
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately.

Given the criteria and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student’s answer fits best in **Level 2**. The errors present do not significantly hinder the overall meaning, and the use of specialist terms is good.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B is useful to a historian learning about military technology and tactics because it shows a way how the British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C is useful because it tells us about an experience that a tank commander was stuck but seven whippet tanks came and pushed the German soldiers away.
This tells us that tanks were very useful and had a big impact on WWI. Tanks were bulletproof, destroy barbed wire and could drive over the enemy trenches. Since tanks could destroy barbed wire, this means that it can make paths for the British to attack the Germans.  ","The student provides a basic analysis of both sources, identifying relevant features and explaining their significance. For Source B, the student notes that it shows British soldiers advancing under an artillery barrage, which is a valid observation. For Source C, the student describes the usefulness of tanks in battle, particularly the Whippet tanks, and their impact on the war.

However, the analysis lacks depth and does not include extended reasoning or detailed contextual knowledge. The student does not evaluate the provenance of the sources or provide a complex evaluation of their utility. To reach a higher level, the student would need to include more specific factual knowledge, evaluate the provenance of the sources, and provide a more detailed analysis of how these sources contribute to understanding military technology and tactics in the First World War.

Analysis:
- **Spelling and Punctuation**: The student spells most words correctly and uses punctuation with considerable accuracy. There are minor issues, such as ""decently"" which might have been intended as ""definitely,"" but this does not significantly hinder understanding.
- **Grammar**: The student generally uses rules of grammar with good control of meaning. There are some awkward phrasings and minor grammatical errors, such as ""Naval army"" instead of ""navy"" and ""This caused them to fight and Britain won,"" which could be clearer. However, these do not significantly obscure the overall meaning.
- **Specialist Terms**: The student uses a good range of specialist terms such as ""allies,"" ""triple entente,"" ""naval army,"" and ""dreadnoughts."" These terms are appropriate and relevant to the topic.

Given the criteria, the student's response fits well within Level 2. The spelling, punctuation, and grammar are handled with considerable accuracy, and the use of specialist terms is appropriate.

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The answer does not clearly identify a specific way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate. The statement ""From internet the business can see where more people are"" is vague and does not directly address the location decision influenced by the internet. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**
  - The explanation provided is somewhat unclear and does not directly link the internet's influence to the location choice. The candidate mentions ""they can also use advertisement on such things eg Instagram, Twitter and Facebook,"" which is more about marketing rather than location choice. The statement ""The more populated the area the more sales the small business can gain and make profit"" is a general business principle and not specifically tied to the internet's impact on location. Therefore, this criterion is not met.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers in the mark scheme provide clear and direct ways the internet affects location choice, such as choosing a cheaper location due to e-commerce or needing a location with good internet connections. The candidate's answer does not align with these examples and lacks clarity and focus on the specific impact of the internet on location choice.

615.38 units","Based on the provided Question, Answer, and Mark Scheme, let's evaluate the given Answer step by step:

1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per unit} - \text{Variable Costs per unit}}
     \]
   - The fixed costs are £10,000.
   - The new selling price per unit is £6.50.
   - The variable costs per unit are £2.50.
   - Substituting these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

Now, let's compare this with the given Answer:

- The given Answer does not correctly apply the formula for the break-even level of output.
- The calculation ""5.00 - 2.50 = 2.50"" is irrelevant to the new selling price of £6.50.
- The division ""4000/650"" and the result ""615.3846154"" are incorrect and do not follow the correct formula or logic.

**Marking:**

- **Substitution into correct formula:** 0 marks (The formula was not correctly applied).
- **Correct calculation and final answer:** 0 marks (The final answer is incorrect and the workings do not lead to the correct answer).

- **Identification of a way:**
  - The candidate identifies multiple ways: ""give out coupons and offers"" and ""match prices with your competitors."" According to the marking notes, answers that list more than one way with no explanation will be awarded a maximum of 1 mark. Therefore, the identification of a way is partially fulfilled but not in the required manner. Award 1 mark.

- **Explanation of the way:**
  - The candidate explains the first way: ""This way people who are on low income can buy things."" This explanation is somewhat relevant but lacks depth. It does not fully explain how giving out coupons and offers would make the business more competitive.
  - The second way is partially explained: ""match prices with your competitors and see how many customers come therefore they can use coupons."" This explanation is fragmented and lacks clarity. It does not fully develop the idea of how matching prices would make the business more competitive.
  - The candidate also mentions advertising coupons and products online, but this is not well integrated into the explanation of how it would make the business more competitive.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provide a clear identification and thorough explanation of one way a small business could become more competitive. For instance, ""A small business could gain an advantage by charging lower prices (1). This would mean customers are more likely to buy the product because it is cheaper than other products (1). Therefore, this would attract customers from its competitors as they want to save money (1).""

#### Identification of an advantage:
- **Criteria**: Identification of an advantage.
- **Evaluation**: The answer does not clearly identify a specific advantage of using retained profit as a source of finance. The statement ""Their profit that they get back will be useful to them"" is too vague and does not pinpoint a particular advantage.
- **Mark Awarded**: 0 marks.

#### Explaining the advantage:
- **Criteria**: Explaining the advantage.
- **Evaluation**: The explanation provided is not specific to retained profit. The candidate mentions, ""They could keep that money saved for later or they could use it on their business to help it thrive,"" but this does not explain why retained profit is advantageous compared to other sources of finance.

- **Outline a way financial information in a business plan could help forecast success:**

","The candidate's response identifies several non-financial aims that could impact Amelia's decision to start Lili Heating Ltd. However, the answer lacks depth and detailed development of these points.

1. **Independence and Being Her Own Boss:**
   - The candidate mentions that Amelia could aim to have independence and be her own boss. This aligns with the indicative content that suggests Amelia may want more independence after working for someone else for six years. However, the response does not develop this point further to explain how this independence could impact her decision-making or business operations.

2. **Expansion and Customer Recommendations:**
   - The candidate states that Amelia could expand her business and ask customers to recommend her to their family and friends. This point is relevant but lacks detailed explanation on how customer recommendations could help her achieve non-financial aims such as building a reputation or gaining a loyal customer base.

3. **Fulfilling Her Dream:**
   - The candidate mentions that Amelia could fulfil her dream of having her own company. This is a valid point but is not expanded upon to show how this dream could drive her determination and commitment to the business.

4. **Aiming for Survival and Customer Loyalty:**
   - The candidate briefly touches on the aim to survive and gain more loyal customers. However, this point is not well-developed and lacks a clear connection to how these aims would impact her decision to start the business.

**Level and Mark Determination:**
- **Application of Knowledge (AO2):** The response shows limited application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts to the context of Amelia's situation. The points mentioned are relevant but not well-developed or contextualized.
- **Analysis (AO3a):** The response attempts to deconstruct the business information but finds limited connections between points. The analysis is superficial and lacks logical chains of reasoning.

Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families.

This is developed through the idea of matching her prices to stay competitive. The candidate further develops the answer by suggesting that Amelia can use secondary data to plan deliveries and find out where she can get more jobs and sales. The response also mentions using resources like Google to see this information and suggests putting her prices on the site. Finally, the candidate mentions researching where in Birmingham there are more customers.

In terms of **Application (AO2)**, the response includes some contextual elements such as ""Amelia,"" ""plumbers,"" ""Birmingham,"" and ""Google."" However, the application is somewhat limited and not consistently detailed throughout the answer.

For **Analysis (AO3a)**, the response attempts to deconstruct the issue by linking the use of the internet for secondary market research to competitive pricing and planning. However, the connections between points are somewhat limited and lack depth. The response does not fully explore the implications or provide detailed interconnected points with logical chains of reasoning.

This depends on how well she does publicity.,"Let's evaluate the given answer against the marking criteria provided in the mark scheme.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer states: ""She could use quality to try and do his. This depends on how well she does publicity.""
   - **Evaluation**: The answer mentions ""quality"" and ""publicity."" However, ""quality"" is not one of the traditional elements of the marketing mix (Product, Place, Promotion, Price). ""Publicity"" could be considered part of ""Promotion,"" but the answer is not clear or specific enough to definitively state this as an element of the marketing mix.
   - **Conclusion**: The answer does not clearly state one of the elements of the marketing mix.

### Example Answers Comparison

- **Example Answer 1**: ""The place of distributing her services to customer homes in Birmingham.""
  - This example clearly identifies ""Place"" as the element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of distributing services in Birmingham.
- **Example Answer 2**: ""Promotion methods to attract female customers.""
  - This example clearly identifies ""Promotion"" as the element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of attracting female customers.
- **Example Answer 3**: ""Product is to repair/install boilers.""
  - This example clearly identifies ""Product"" as the element of the marketing mix and applies it to the context of repairing/installing boilers.

### Marking Notes

- **Application Evidence**: To award 1 mark, there must be evidence of application.
  - The answer does not provide clear evidence of application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd. The mention of ""quality"" and ""publicity"" is vague and does not directly relate to the specific elements of the marketing mix as applied to the business context.

### Conclusion

Based on the evaluation, the answer does not successfully fulfill the criteria of stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd. and does not provide clear evidence of application.

  - The answer provides a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful: ""The government want small business to thrive and they also don't have to fund them."" This is a valid point, but it lacks specific development and context related to Lili Heating Ltd.

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer does not clearly outline a specific benefit to customers of Ripple. The statement ""This is primary data that helps by knowing the demand not buying time"" is vague and does not directly address a benefit to the customers.
  - The mark scheme example answers provide clear benefits such as ""Customers will receive the correct green energy plan"" or ""This will make sure they receive the correct amount of energy for their needs."" The given answer does not align with these examples.

- **Linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer lacks linked development and evidence of application. The statement ""This helps them get new ideas and objectives and help them to acknowledge their customers"" is not clearly linked to a specific benefit for the customers. It is more focused on the business's perspective rather than the customers'.
  - The mark scheme requires linked points outlining a benefit to customers with evidence of application. The given answer does not meet this criterion.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - Since the points in the answer are not linked and do not clearly outline a benefit to customers, the response can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

  example_answer: 
    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

However, the application of knowledge and understanding of business concepts (AO2) is limited and lacks depth. The answer mentions the potential for business growth and job creation, but it does not provide detailed or specific contextual information about Ripple or the green energy sector.

The analysis (AO3a) is also limited. The candidate makes some connections between points, such as the benefit of free training attracting new employees and creating a better working environment, but these points are not well-developed or logically interconnected. The reasoning is somewhat jumbled and lacks clarity.

The evaluation (AO3b) is present but simplistic. The candidate concludes that growth is essential for a business to thrive, but this judgement is based on a limited evaluation of the information provided. There is no thorough evaluation or consideration of potential drawbacks or alternative perspectives.

Overall, this answer demonstrates a basic understanding of business concepts and makes simple connections between points, placing it in Level 1. The answer does not reach the level of sound application or detailed analysis required for higher levels.

The points made are not clearly connected, and there is a significant amount of repetition and unclear statements. 

1. **Knowledge and Understanding (AO1b):**
   - The candidate demonstrates limited knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues. The terminology used is not always appropriate or accurate. For example, phrases like ""marking mix"" and ""source of enemy"" are incorrect and indicate a lack of understanding.
   - Level 1 is appropriate here due to the limited and often incorrect use of business terminology.

2. **Application (AO2):**
   - The application of knowledge to the business context is minimal. The candidate mentions Ripple's prices and competitors but does not effectively link these points to the context of Ripple's business model or the importance of price in their marketing mix.
   - The response does not provide a detailed or accurate application of the business context, thus fitting Level 1 criteria.

3. **Analysis (AO3a):**
   - The candidate attempts to deconstruct business information but fails to find meaningful connections between points. The analysis is superficial and lacks depth.
   - Statements like ""Ripple marking mix help men decide whether they want to raise or lower their prices"" are vague and do not provide a clear analysis of the marketing mix or pricing strategy.
   - This fits the Level 1 descriptor of finding limited connections between points.

4. **Evaluation (AO3b):**
   - The candidate makes some judgments, but they are not well-justified or based on a thorough evaluation of business information. The conclusion is not clear or well-reasoned.
   - The evaluation is simplistic and does not provide a strong justification for the points made, fitting the Level 1 criteria.

Overall, the response is placed in Level 1 due to the limited application of knowledge, superficial analysis, and lack of coherent evaluation. The response demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding but fails to effectively apply or analyze the business context.

    - None","Source B A picture published in a British newspaper in October 1917. It shows readers
how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","Source B is useful to some extent as it only shows the use of the creeping barrage. This was used by the Allied forces to gain territory as artillery would fire shells infront of the tanks to hit the ground and form a shield of debris, the tanks would then cover the soldiers (soldiers would hide behind tanks for cover) and when they get close enough to enemy trenches, whatever enemy soldiers have not died to the bombardment of shells, would die from soldiers who would attack behind the tanks and tanks which would have machine guns attached to them.

Also source C is also useful as it highlights the role of tanks in the war. Tanks were used in the war to gain a lot of territory. In 1916, they broke down easily and were left on the battle field for the germans to steal and use. However, in 1917 they were made more reliable. They were used to go over barbed wire and to shield soldiers from machine gun fire. In this source, the whippets, fastest tanks, were smaller tanks that could go over barbed wire and also into enemy trenches without getting stuck. ","The student demonstrates a basic understanding of the content of both sources, identifying relevant features and explaining their significance. For Source B, the student describes the use of the creeping barrage and how it was employed to protect advancing soldiers and tanks. For Source C, the student explains the role of tanks, particularly the 'Whippets,' in gaining territory and overcoming obstacles like barbed wire.

However, the evaluation of the sources is quite simplistic and lacks depth. The student does not provide much contextual knowledge or detailed analysis of the provenance of the sources. For example, the student could have discussed the significance of Source B being published in a British newspaper in 1917, possibly as a form of propaganda to boost morale. Similarly, for Source C, the student could have elaborated on the reliability and perspective of Frank Mitchell as a tank commander and how his first-hand account adds value to the source.

To reach a higher level, the student would need to provide more detailed contextual knowledge, evaluate the provenance of the sources more thoroughly, and make more explicit connections to the utility of the sources for a historian studying military technology and tactics in the First World War.

total_marks:
  - 2",,6000 units,"To grade the provided answer, let's break down the steps according to the mark scheme:

1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   - The correct formula for the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per Unit} - \text{Variable Costs per Unit}}

2. **Calculating the decrease in the break-even level of output:**
   - The original break-even level of output is 4,000 units.
   - The new break-even level of output is 2,500 units.
   - The decrease in the break-even level of output is:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The correct decrease in the break-even level of output is 1,500 units.

  example_answer: []",,"In 1914, Schlieffen sent out soldiers to attack France through Belgium. He wanted to prevent a war on two fronts, as a result of this, he hoped to defeat France in 10 days and focus all his power to Russia on the eastern front as he thought Russia would take weeks to mobilise their forces. I chimmy was part of the British expeditionary forces (BEF) and due to the treaty we signed with Russia, me and my men were sent to Belgium to hold the line at the border, so that Germany would not have victory. German men had very poor co-ordination as they did not expect the Belgians to prepare. They were met with barricades of sandbags and light gun fire. As we got there, we set our machine guns and blew up bridges to stop the Germans from getting to France. Around 120,000 men came with me and around 500 came back. But we were able to hold back the Germans for weeks which gave the Russia, who the Germans thought would mobilise later, day to mobilise causing Germany to split their troops and fight a war on two fronts. If the Germans never decided to attack France through Belgium millions of lives could have been save.","The student provides a narrative account of the Schlieffen Plan and its execution in 1914. The answer begins with an explanation of the plan's objectives and the strategic reasoning behind it, which shows an understanding of the context. The student mentions the German advance through Belgium and the involvement of the British Expeditionary Forces (BEF), which aligns with the historical events.

However, the answer lacks a coherent structure and detailed factual knowledge. The narrative is somewhat disjointed, and the inclusion of a personal anecdote (""I chimmy was part of the British expeditionary forces"") detracts from the academic tone required for this type of response. The student does not provide specific dates or detailed analysis of the consequences of the Schlieffen Plan's failure, such as the Battle of the Marne or the resulting stalemate and trench warfare.

To reach Level 3, the student would need to develop the analysis further, providing a structured and well-ordered narrative that demonstrates a range of accurate knowledge and understanding. This would include specific details about the German advance, the resistance by Belgian and British forces, and the impact on the Western Front.

    - N/A",,"I partly agree because, the alliance system caused tensions between countries e.g. Britain, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Russia. It made one country want to be better than the other and so if Germany mobilized their Panzer, Britain would build a dreadnought and then Germany would build a replica and give it a different name. However, the July Crisis was one of the main causes of the war. Franz Ferdinand was assassinated by a group called the black hand gang this caused tension in Serbia as the Austro-Hungarian Government forced information out of some members of the Black Hand which gave links to Serbia supplying the black hand with weapons and information. 
The Serbian government were passed laws that they had to follow. They followed all of them but one which stated that Austro-Hungary police was allowed in the Serbian streets to patrol. As Serbia rejected this, Austro-Hungary declared war on them. This caused Germany to pledge support to Austro-Hungary (A.H). This led to Russia declaring war on Germany and due to the alliance that France had with Russia, they were forced to join the war and declared war on Germany.
By this point Britain had not yet declared war on anyone. However, Germany due to the Schliefen plan were going to attack France through Belgium and considering the Britain treaty with Belgium they declared war on Germany.
Also, the Moroccan crises was another main reason for World war one starting because, 
France had just humiliated Germany by securing Morocco as an ally. However, due to the Kaisers temper and need for revenge, he was willing to jump at any chance thrown at him to go to war with France because he wanted revenge on France for securing an ally that Germany needed for resources.
The alliance system did cause tension between countries involved in the war, but if Franz Ferdinand was not assassinated, World War One may never have started.","The student begins by addressing the stated factor, the alliance system, and explains how it caused tensions between countries. They provide specific examples, such as the arms race between Britain and Germany, which demonstrates some knowledge and understanding. However, the explanation is somewhat simplistic and lacks depth, which places it in Level 2.

The student then moves on to explain the July Crisis and the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. They provide a detailed account of the events that followed the assassination, including the involvement of the Black Hand gang, the Austro-Hungarian ultimatum to Serbia, and the subsequent declarations of war. This section shows a good range of factual knowledge and understanding and explains the causation in a developed way, which is characteristic of Level 3.

The student also mentions the Moroccan Crises as another reason for the war, explaining how the Kaiser's desire for revenge against France contributed to the tensions. This is another relevant factor, but the explanation is brief and lacks the depth needed for Level 3.

The conclusion attempts to make a judgement by stating that the alliance system caused tension but that the assassination of Franz Ferdinand was a more immediate cause. However, the judgement is not fully substantiated, and the conclusion is somewhat repetitive of earlier points.

Overall, the answer demonstrates a mix of Level 2 and Level 3 characteristics. The explanation of the July Crisis is well-developed and shows a good understanding of the events, but the other factors are explained more simply. The answer falls into Level 3 but at the lower end due to the lack of depth in some explanations and the somewhat simplistic conclusion.

    - The learner writes nothing. The learner’s response does not relate to the question. The learner’s achievement in SPaG does not reach the threshold performance level, for example, errors in spelling, punctuation, and grammar severely hinder meaning.",,"I partly agree because, the alliance system caused tensions between countries e.g. Britain, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Russia. It made one country want to be better than the other and so if Germany mobilized their Panzer, Britain would build a dreadnought and then Germany would build a replica and give it a different name. However, the July Crisis was one of the main causes of the war. Franz Ferdinand was assassinated by a group called the black hand gang this caused tension in Serbia as the Austro-Hungarian Government forced information out of some members of the Black Hand which gave links to Serbia supplying the black hand with weapons and information. 
The Serbian government were passed laws that they had to follow. They followed all of them but one which stated that Austro-Hungary police was allowed in the Serbian streets to patrol. As Serbia rejected this, Austro-Hungary declared war on them. This caused Germany to pledge support to Austro-Hungary (A.H). This led to Russia declaring war on Germany and due to the alliance that France had with Russia, they were forced to join the war and declared war on Germany.
By this point Britain had not yet declared war on anyone. However, Germany due to the Schliefen plan were going to attack France through Belgium and considering the Britain treaty with Belgium they declared war on Germany.
Also, the Moroccan crises was another main reason for World war one starting because, 
France had just humiliated Germany by securing Morocco as an ally. However, due to the Kaisers temper and need for revenge, he was willing to jump at any chance thrown at him to go to war with France because he wanted revenge on France for securing an ally that Germany needed for resources.
The alliance system did cause tension between countries involved in the war, but if Franz Ferdinand was not assassinated, World War One may never have started.","Based on the provided Mark Scheme, here is the analysis of the student's answer:

### Spelling:
- The student spells most words correctly, including specialist terms like ""Panzer,"" ""dreadnought,"" ""Schlieffen plan,"" and ""Moroccan crises.""
- There are minor spelling errors, such as ""black hand gang"" (should be ""Black Hand Gang"") and ""Austro-Hungary"" (should be ""Austro-Hungarian"").

### Punctuation:
- The student uses punctuation with considerable accuracy. There are commas, periods, and capital letters used appropriately.
- There are minor punctuation errors, such as missing commas in some places (e.g., ""because, the alliance system"" should be ""because the alliance system"") and inconsistent use of capitalization for ""black hand gang.""

### Grammar:
- The student generally uses rules of grammar with good control of meaning overall. The sentences are mostly clear and convey the intended meaning.
- There are some grammatical errors, such as ""the Serbian government were passed laws"" (should be ""the Serbian government was passed laws"") and ""the Britain treaty"" (should be ""the British treaty"").

### Use of Specialist Terms:
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms appropriately, such as ""Panzer,"" ""dreadnought,"" ""Schlieffen plan,"" and ""Moroccan crises.""

### Overall Assessment:
- The student spells and punctuates with considerable accuracy, though not with consistent accuracy.
- The student uses rules of grammar with general control of meaning overall, though there are some errors.
- The student uses a good range of specialist terms as appropriate.

Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer fits best in **Level 2**. The errors present do not significantly hinder the overall meaning, and the use of specialist terms is good.

1. **Substitution into the correct formula:**
   - The correct formula to use is: Opening Balance + (Cash Inflows - Cash Outflows).
   - The student has attempted to use the formula but made an error in the calculation.
   - The correct substitution should be: £4,000 + (£8,600 - £11,000).

2. **Answer:**
   - The correct answer should be £1,600.
   - The student's final answer is £1,600, but the working is incorrect.

Let's evaluate the student's answer step-by-step:

- The student calculated: 11,000 - 8,600 = 2,400 (incorrect calculation, should be -2,400).
- Then, they calculated: 4,000 - 2,400 = 1,600 (incorrect working but correct final answer).

Given the instructions to award marks for correct working despite the final answer being incorrect, we should consider the following:

- The student did not correctly substitute into the formula, so they do not earn the mark for correct substitution.
- The final answer is correct (£1,600), but it was reached through incorrect working.

- Substitution into correct formula: 0 marks (incorrect working).

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one element of the marketing mix for Lili Heating Ltd.**
   - The answer states ""product,"" which is indeed one of the elements of the marketing mix. This satisfies the requirement of stating an element of the marketing mix.

### Application to Context

- **Evidence of Application:**
  - The mark scheme requires evidence of application to award 1 mark. The answer ""product"" is a valid element of the marketing mix, but it does not provide any specific application to Lili Heating Ltd. The context mentions that Amelia's business involves plumbing services, such as repairing and installing boilers. An example answer from the mark scheme is ""Product is to repair/install boilers,"" which clearly applies the element to the specific context of Lili Heating Ltd.
  - The given answer ""product"" lacks this specific application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria for evidence of application.

### Conclusion

- The answer correctly identifies an element of the marketing mix but fails to apply it specifically to Lili Heating Ltd as required by the mark scheme.

### Marks Awarded

- **0 marks**: The answer does not provide evidence of application to the context of Lili Heating Ltd.

- **Linked points outlining a reason why the government would want Lili Heating Ltd to be successful:**
  - The answer states, ""not many women are plumbers and they would want to have more women involved in that job sector."" This suggests a reason why the government might want the business to succeed, as it could promote gender diversity in the plumbing sector. However, the points are not fully linked to show a clear cause-and-effect relationship. The response lacks explicit linkage between the success of Lili Heating Ltd and the government's interest in promoting gender diversity.

- **Maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - The points in the answer are not sufficiently linked. The response does not clearly connect the success of Lili Heating Ltd with the government's desire to have more women in the plumbing sector. Therefore, it can only be awarded a maximum of 1 mark.

**Example Answers Comparison:**
- The example answers provide clear linkage and development, such as ""The government will collect more tax if Lili Heating Ltd is successful (1). Taxes will be based on the profits it makes from plumbing repairs (1)."" The given answer does not achieve this level of clarity and linkage.

  example_answer: 
    - Female customers often feel they cannot trust male plumbers when they give them prices to repair their houses. If Amelia offers a discount to female customers, it will make them aware that she is trying to help them overcome this problem (AO3a).
","Amelia Cooper trained as a plumber six years ago. Since then she has worked for a building company that carries out repairs to houses and business premises in the Birmingham area.
Amelia is now in a position where she wants to start her own plumbing business called Lili Heating Ltd. Even though there are many plumbers in the Birmingham area Amelia feels she has a unique selling point – she is a woman. Many female customers feel that they can relate more closely with a woman doing repairs in their homes.
As part of her business plan, Amelia has identified some clear aims and objectives and conducted a large amount of market research using the internet. Her target market requires clear advice on what work needs to be done and how much she will charge. Amelia also thinks she can cut down on advertising costs by getting her customers to recommend Lili Heating Ltd to their friends and families. For this to happen she knows that her work must be of the highest standard.
Amelia’s business plan also included a wide range of financial information to help her forecast the potential success of the business and see if she would need an overdraft.","Option 2 is the better option because it has very low risk. A lot of people use social media both for work and leisure and if she has adverts between YouTube videos or on a site, then more people would learn about her business and she can grow her business easier as they have more customers.

However if she chose to offer a discount to only the female customers, a lot of male customers could feel maltreated and not want to use her plumbing service as she only favours one gender and not the other. This leaves a gap in the market where another plumbing business could offer a discount for both male and female customers and then they will attract more customers.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 2 is the better choice, providing a rationale that social media has a broad reach and can help grow the business by attracting more customers. This demonstrates some application of business concepts to the context of Lili Heating Ltd (AO2). However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed understanding, which limits it to Level 1.

The candidate then discusses the potential downside of Option 1, suggesting that offering discounts only to female customers could alienate male customers. This shows an attempt at evaluation (AO3b), but the analysis is basic and lacks interconnected points or detailed reasoning, keeping it within Level 1.

Overall, the answer demonstrates limited application and understanding of business concepts, with basic analysis and a simple judgement.

### Marking Criteria Evaluation

1. **Stating one risk for investors in Ripple:**
   - The answer ""Business failure"" does state a potential risk for investors. However, it is very general and lacks specific application to Ripple's context. According to the marking notes, there must be evidence of application to award the mark.

### Contextual Application

- The context mentions that Ripple is a consumer-owned wind farm providing green energy. A more specific risk related to this context could be:
  - ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy"" (as per the example answers in the mark scheme).
  - ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" (another example from the mark scheme).

### Evidence from the Answer

- The answer ""Business failure"" does not provide specific evidence or application to Ripple's unique business model or the renewable energy sector. It is too vague and does not directly tie into the context provided.

### Comparison with Example Answers

- The example answers in the mark scheme provide specific risks that are directly tied to the context of Ripple's business model:
  - ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" directly ties to the investment aspect.
  - ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy"" ties to the renewable energy market.

### Conclusion

- The answer ""Business failure"" does not sufficiently meet the criteria of stating a specific risk for investors in Ripple with evidence of application. It is too general and lacks the necessary context-specific detail.

### Marks Awarded

- **0 marks**: The answer does not fulfill the criteria of providing a specific, contextually relevant risk for investors in Ripple.

### Final Remarks

- To improve the answer, it should specify a risk that directly relates to Ripple's business model and the renewable energy sector, such as ""Loss of money invested in the wind farm"" or ""Business may fail due to lack of demand for renewable energy.""",0,0,1,,,TRUE,,,,,,,5.953019857,"{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 642, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.00321, 'completion_tokens': 409, 'completion_cost': 0.006135, 'total_cost': 0.009345}","{'burn_in_runs': 1, 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'prompt_tokens': 447, 'prompt_token_cost': 0.002235, 'completion_tokens': 1, 'completion_cost': 1.5e-05, 'total_cost': 0.00225}"

- **Benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer states, ""Their customer needs can be met quicker instead of the business carrying out market research."" This implies a benefit to customers in terms of speed and efficiency. However, the benefit is not explicitly clear or directly linked to the context of Ripple's operations. The mark scheme example answers focus on specific benefits such as receiving the correct green energy plan or the correct amount of energy for their needs. The provided answer does not clearly articulate a specific benefit to the customers in the context of Ripple's services. Therefore, this criterion is not fully satisfied.

- **Award up to 2 marks for linked points outlining a benefit to customers of Ripple:**
  - The answer does not provide linked points. It mentions a single point about meeting customer needs quicker but does not develop this point further or link it to a specific benefit related to Ripple's services. Therefore, this criterion is not satisfied.

- **Award a maximum of 1 mark if points are not linked:**
  - Since the answer provides a single point without linked development, it can be awarded a maximum of 1 mark. The point about meeting customer needs quicker is valid but lacks the necessary development and context-specific detail to earn full marks.

- **To award 2 marks there must be linked development and evidence of application:**
  - The answer does not provide linked development or evidence of application to Ripple's specific context. It lacks the necessary detail to show how the quicker identification of customer needs directly benefits Ripple's customers in terms of their green energy plans or investments.

    - Training courses can be expensive. Sending new employees on these courses would increase the costs of Ripple. Therefore, if the government pays for this training then Ripple could focus more of its members’ investment into expanding the wind farm (AO3a).
    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

It will also limit the business failure because there will be employees trained to fix any broken windmills and plant fruit and veg.
However, Option 1 doesn't limit business failure as they could spend the cash they have not been taxed on the wrong products or services and they still have to pay for employee training.","The candidate begins by stating that Option 2 is more beneficial, providing a clear preference. They justify this by explaining that employing more people who are trained for free would allow Ripple to use profits for other improvements, which is a sound application of business concepts (AO2). The candidate also mentions that this would limit business failure due to having trained employees to fix broken windmills, which shows some interconnected reasoning (AO3a).

However, the candidate's explanation includes some inconsistencies and lacks depth. For example, the mention of planting fruit and veg is irrelevant to the context of Ripple's business. Additionally, the candidate's evaluation of Option 1 is limited and somewhat simplistic, suggesting that the business could spend untaxed cash on the wrong products or services without further elaboration (AO3b).

This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.","The price payed by the customers could decide the amount of energy is operating in their home. Ripple claim to supply energy cheaper than its competitors, by doing this more people would pay for cheaper yet reliable energy as an investment into a business. They are paying for energy and are also investing in a business at the same time.

If the price of energy was too expensive, customers would go to Ripple's competitors and Ripple would not have the investment of a lot of customers to pay workers wages, improve the quality of the farm and the windmills. For example if another business comes to them and say they want to power a car showroom and they pay only £1,000, they will not have a lot of energy but if they offer £1,000,000 they will have enough energy and Ripple will be able to improve their facilities to make sure the energy that they are providing their customers with is the best.","The candidate begins by discussing the importance of price in Ripple's marketing mix, noting that the price paid by customers determines the amount of energy they receive. This shows an understanding of the relationship between price and product offering. The candidate also mentions that Ripple claims to supply energy cheaper than its competitors, which could attract more customers. This demonstrates some application of knowledge to the business context (AO2).

In the second paragraph, the candidate discusses the potential negative impact of high prices, suggesting that customers might turn to competitors if Ripple's prices are too high. This is a valid point and shows an attempt to deconstruct business information (AO3a). The candidate also provides an example involving a car showroom, which adds some context but lacks clarity and depth.

However, the response lacks detailed interconnected points and logical chains of reasoning. The evaluation is limited and does not provide a thorough justification based on a sound evaluation of business information and issues (AO3b). The conclusion is implicit rather than explicit, and the overall analysis is somewhat superficial.

Overall, the response demonstrates elements of knowledge and understanding of business concepts and issues, with limited business terminology used. The application of knowledge to the business context is limited, and the deconstruction of business information is basic. The response fits best within Level 1.

how British soldiers advance under an artillery barrage.

Source C: Adapted from the book ‘Tank Warfare: the Story of the Tank in the Great War’ by
Frank Mitchell, published after the war.
Mitchell was a tank commander in the First World War and describes part of a
tank battle which took place during the German Spring Offensive in
April 1918. Mitchell was awarded a medal for bravery in this battle.

```
We were stuck and German soldiers were preparing to attack my tank. But
then on my right I saw seven of our newest and fastest tanks, ‘Whippets’,
racing into action.
Firing their machine guns, they drove straight into the German soldiers, and
scattered them in all directions. They quickly destroyed the German threat.
```","These sources are very useful to an historian studying military technology and tactics during the first world war because it shows the benefits of the use of technology during battle and conflicts, if it wasn't for the newest and fastest tanks constructed by the use of modern and advanced technology, the soldiers stuck in the battle that were almost getting attacked in their tanks by the germans wouldn't have survived because as soon as the new tanks came racing into action and firing, the German soldiers threat was destroyed. This shows us how easier and efficient technology can be helping us against fighting during war. ","The student provides a basic analysis of Source C, identifying the key feature of the new tanks, 'Whippets,' and explaining their impact on the battle. However, the response lacks depth and does not address Source B at all. There is no evaluation of the provenance of either source, and the analysis is not developed with extended reasoning or contextual knowledge.

To improve, the student should include an analysis of Source B, discussing how it shows British soldiers advancing under an artillery barrage and what this indicates about military tactics and technology during the First World War. Additionally, the student should evaluate the provenance of both sources, considering their reliability and usefulness to a historian.

  example_answer: []",,The Schlieffen plan was made by the German army general. His plan was to invade France and continuing the invasion of other countries. He planned that the German army would defeat the French army in 10 weeks and he knew that the Russia was going to back France but it was going to take a long time for the Russians army to mobilize. So the Germans start to invade France but to get to France they had to pass the Belgium border the Germans knew the British signed a treaty with Belgium that they were going to back Belgium in case of war. But the German general thought the British won't keep to the treaty so the Germans troops invaded Belgium. When the British realized what happen they were angry and was going to back Belgium so they sent a warning letter to the German emperor telling them to take all their troops of Belgium but the Germans keep ignoring the British. So Britain declared war on Germany. Immediately Britain troops got to Belgium and the British and Belgian troops fought against the German. But the Germans troops were too much Russia had mobilize his army in 10 days and they got sent to help the British in the war against the German. Which led for the German having a war on two fronts.,"The student provides a basic narrative of the Schlieffen Plan and its consequences, but the answer lacks depth and detailed analysis. The student identifies key events such as the German invasion of Belgium, the British response, and the Russian mobilization. However, the explanation is somewhat disjointed and lacks specific factual knowledge and understanding.

The answer moves beyond Level 1 by identifying relevant events and showing a basic understanding of causation and consequence. However, it does not reach Level 2 because it lacks a structured account and specific knowledge that is relevant to the question. The student does not provide a clear analysis of how the Schlieffen Plan led to problems in 1914, such as the stalemate on the Western Front or the broader implications for the war.

To reach Level 2, the student would need to provide a more structured account with specific knowledge and understanding, such as the impact of the Battle of the Marne or the significance of trench warfare.

### Analysis:

1. **Spelling:**
   - There are several spelling errors:
     - ""know"" should be ""known""
     - ""emperur"" should be ""emperor""
     - ""bosnia"" should be ""Bosnian""
     - ""hungary"" should be ""Hungary"" (inconsistent capitalization)
     - ""slavs"" should be ""Slavs""
   - However, most words are spelled correctly, and the errors do not severely hinder understanding.

2. **Punctuation:**
   - There are multiple punctuation issues:
     - Missing commas and periods, leading to run-on sentences.
     - Inconsistent capitalization of ""Austria-Hungary"" and ""Serbia"".
     - Incorrect use of colons and semicolons.
     - Lack of apostrophes in possessive forms (e.g., ""Austria-Hungary's"").
   - Despite these issues, the meaning is generally clear.

3. **Grammar:**
   - There are several grammatical errors:
     - ""this made they feeling more brave"" should be ""this made them feel braver"".
     - ""wanting to go to war"" should be ""wanted to go to war"".
     - ""didn't interfere"" should be ""did not interfere"".
     - ""got assassinated"" should be ""was assassinated"".
   - The overall control of meaning is maintained, though the errors do affect the fluidity and clarity of the text.

4. **Use of Specialist Terms:**
   - The student uses several specialist terms appropriately, such as ""Triple Alliance"", ""annexed"", ""ultimatum"", and ""assassinated"".
   - The range of specialist terms is good but not particularly wide.

### Conclusion:
Given the criteria in the Mark Scheme and the forgiving nature of the grading, the student's answer demonstrates:

- **Considerable accuracy** in spelling and punctuation, though not consistent.
- **General control** of grammar, with errors that do not significantly hinder meaning.

This answer does not provide sufficient information to meet the criteria outlined in the mark scheme. Let's break down the criteria and evaluate the response accordingly:

- **Identification of a way (1 mark):**
  - The answer does not identify any specific way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate. The response merely repeats the question: ""one way the internet may affect where a small business chooses to locate."" Therefore, it does not fulfill this criterion.

- **Explanation of the way (up to 2 additional marks):**

### Mark Scheme Breakdown:
1. **Substitution into correct formula:**
   - The formula for break-even level of output is: 
     \[
     \text{Break-even level of output} = \frac{\text{Fixed Costs}}{\text{Selling Price per unit} - \text{Variable Cost per unit}}
     \]
   - Substituting the new selling price:
     \[
     \text{New break-even level of output} = \frac{£10,000}{£6.50 - £2.50} = \frac{£10,000}{£4.00} = 2,500 \text{ units}
     \]

2. **Calculation of decrease in break-even level of output:**
   - Original break-even level of output: 4,000 units
   - New break-even level of output: 2,500 units
   - Decrease in break-even level of output:
     \[
     4,000 \text{ units} - 2,500 \text{ units} = 1,500 \text{ units}
     \]

The provided answer does not show any of the required calculations or substitutions. It only lists the fixed cost, variable cost, selling price, and level of output without performing any operations or showing any workings.

  - Therefore, by setting up Lili Heating Ltd she can be her own boss and make her own decisions. She no longer has to carry out repairs on houses for someone else (AO3a).

Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy.

    - However, the business is owned by the customers and the main objective may not be profit maximisation. This would limit the effect that any reduction in tax would have on the business (AO3b).
    - However, the business is located in a remote area of the country and may not need to employ many people to manage the wind farm. Therefore, they might not have enough training requirements to fully benefit from the government strategy (AO3b).

It is the country’s first consumer-owned wind farm, generating green energy that does not have a damaging effect on the environment. Instead of customers paying Ripple to supply them with energy they become members of the business and buy a part of a wind farm located in a remote area of South Wales. Customers are then supplied with energy to their homes based on the amount of money they invested. The amount of money that customers can invest varies on their energy needs, but Ripple claims that it can supply energy cheaper than its competitors. The process of becoming a member is very simple. Firstly, Ripple will ask customers a few questions to identify their energy needs. It will then create a green energy plan to establish how much each customer should invest into the wind farm. Ripple manages the wind farm and provides energy to each customer’s home or business. Ripple’s business plan fits in with the UK government’s cleaner energy strategy. This strategy includes plans for the country to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to create 220,000 new jobs in the green energy sector of the economy.",,No Answer is provided.
