This process was called artillery barrage, additionally Source B would also be useful to a historian due to the fact that the source was made by a British newspaper this hints to the fact that the newspaper is going to want to present the tactic as being flawless. On the other hand Source C is useful to a historian studying military technology and tactics in the first World War because, the Source is talking about tanks and their new versions, this is useful as it is showing how the British went from tanks that were sent out in ones which led to them being easily picked out and broken by tanks being upgraded and being sent out in groups of 7's, 10, 20's etc, due to the tanks being sent out in groups this led to mass destruction and caused the German soldiers to be scared, it also nullified things such as barbed wire as the tanks could just go over them and flatten them causing the soldiers to be able to easily pass through without being cut, the tanks also provided cover, due to their size and speed multiple soldiers could follow from behind, and the tanks were also upgraded from just having a big cannon that took a long time to turn to having machine guns at the top that could turn a whole 360°, this is useful as it shows the evolution in weapons.\",\n",

For Source B, the student explains the tactic of artillery barrage and how it was used to create a barrier for soldiers, pushing back the enemy until the trench was reached. The student also evaluates the provenance by noting that the source was published by a British newspaper, which might present the tactic as flawless. This shows an understanding of potential bias, which is a key aspect of evaluating the usefulness of a source.\\n\\nFor Source C, the student describes the evolution of tank technology and tactics, explaining how newer tanks like the 'Whippets' were faster, more numerous, and equipped with machine guns, which made them more effective in battle. The student also notes the impact of these tanks on the battlefield, such as their ability to flatten barbed wire and provide cover for soldiers. This detailed analysis of the content, combined with the understanding of the source's provenance (a first-hand account by a tank commander), makes the evaluation comprehensive.\\n\\nHowever, the student could improve by explicitly linking the content and provenance to the utility for historians more consistently. For example, they could state more clearly how the first-hand account in Source C provides a reliable perspective on the effectiveness of tanks, or how the British newspaper's portrayal in Source B might influence public perception of military tactics.\\n\\nOverall, the answer demonstrates developed evaluation of both sources based on content and provenance, with extended reasoning related to utility. Therefore, this answer falls into Level 3 and should be awarded 9 marks.

       "  'answer_text': 'Source B is useful to a historian because it shows a tactic called creeping barrage. This tactic was made so that Britain could gain some land and push the Germans back. In the picture it shows that artillery shells would be fired in front of the troops which would be giving the troops cover to jump into shell holes. This tactic worked majority of the times, but had one big problem. The shells were going so close that if they were fired wrong then they would kill their own soldiers.\\n\\nSource C is useful to a historian because it talks about the development of tanks. At first tanks were slow which made them an easy target for the germans. The british used the tanks in large groups followed by soldiers. The tanks would provide cover for soldiers and they could destroy barbed wire so the troops could get through later on tanks were improved they were faster and better weapons on board for example bigger shells and turrets. The turrets meant that they could fire fast and in 360°. ',\n",

       "  'answer_text': 'Source B shows a depiction of the Western Front with two types of new technology and tactics being shown. The Creeping barrage (presented in 1915) was when shells were fired in front of the advancing foot soldiers to hide them from enemy vision. This meant a decrease in loss of lives and allowed more prepared assaults rather than men going over the top and getting shot in their thousands. One of the reasons this was perfected in 1918 was the better use of communication. Radio being used more frequently helped communiction between aerial support, the troops and the artillery gunners. This minimised the chance of friendly deaths from friendly fire showing Source B is a very useful piece of evidence to show the impact and versatility of technology and tactic in the the First World War. \\n\\nSource C is a account of a tank commander who fought against the Germans in the Spring offensive. Tanks were first used in the Battle of the Somme and were unreliable and used sparingly. however as the war went on they were produced in vast numbers and used in groups. they could decimate trenches and cause great havoc. though the Germans did make some, the Allies used them in wide-scale front and they were pivotal to the end of the stalemate. Source C \\ndescribes how the army constantly made new prototypes \\nas the tanks so they could be faster and cause \\nmore casualties. This meant there was less hand to \\nhand fighting because of the tanks physiological and \\ndevastating effects they had on the enemy. Source C \\nis useful to a historian because it has personal \\nstory from someone actually experiencing the power \\nof tanks, showing how the threat they brought. ',\n",

This shows a developed evaluation of the content of Source B, supported by contextual knowledge.\\n\\nFor Source C, the student describes the evolution and impact of tanks during the First World War, particularly during the German Spring Offensive. They highlight the improvements in tank design and their psychological and tactical effects on the battlefield. The student also notes that Source C is a first-hand account from a tank commander, which adds credibility and usefulness to the source.

Additionally, the student could further develop their evaluation of the relationship between the two sources, as required for Level 4.\\n\\nOverall, the answer falls into Level 3 due to the developed evaluation of both sources based on content and some consideration of provenance. To reach Level 4, the student would need to provide a more complex evaluation of the provenance of Source B and explicitly discuss the relationship between the sources.\\n\\nOverall, this answer falls into Level 3 and should be awarded 9 marks.',\n",

    "Student Answer:\n",
    "I agree to some extent that the alliance system was the main cause of WW1. The 'Alliance system' was a factor in the causes of WW1 because, for example, Austria-Hungary had annexed Bosnia so Serbia was unhappy. Serbia had then got Russia involved which left Austria getting Germany's help because they had signed the 'blank cheque'. Another example was the failure of the Schlieffen plan as Britain and France were an alliance and they had step foot in Belgium (Britain and Belgium signed a treaty). In conclusion I agree to a certain extent that the alliance system was the main cause that that had led to WWI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graded Answer:\n",
    "The student provides a basic explanation of the alliance system and its role in the causes of WW1. They mention the involvement of Austria-Hungary, Serbia, Russia, and Germany, as well as the failure of the Schlieffen Plan and the involvement of Britain and Belgium. However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed factual knowledge. The student does not fully develop their reasoning or provide a sustained line of argument.\\n\\nThe answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding of the alliance system and its impact on the outbreak of WW1. The line of reasoning is coherent but not well-developed or substantiated. The conclusion is brief and does not add much to the overall argument.\\n\\nTo reach a higher level, the student would need to provide a more detailed and developed explanation of the alliance system and other factors that contributed to the outbreak of WW1. They should also aim to create a more sustained and coherent line of reasoning, supported by accurate and detailed factual knowledge.\\n\\nOverall, the answer falls into Level 1 and should be awarded 4 marks.\n",

    "Student Feedback:\n",
    "You've made a good start by acknowledging the role of the alliance system, and it's clear that you have some understanding of how different nations were involved. Here are specific ways you can improve your response to achieve higher marks:\n",
    "1. **Deepen Your Explanation of the Alliance System**: You mentioned that the alliance system was a factor in the causes of WWI, but it's important to elaborate on how it functioned. For instance, you could explain that the alliance system created a network of treaties that turned a local conflict into a larger war. Try mentioning how the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy) and the Triple Entente (Britain, France, and Russia) were designed to provide mutual defense and how this heightened tensions. This added detail shows a deeper understanding of the alliances' implications.\n",
    "2. **Provide More Detailed Factual Knowledge**: While you discuss the involvement of Austria-Hungary, Serbia, and Russia, try to enhance your argument with specific details. For example, you noted that Russia supported Serbia after Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia. You could mention how this annexation caused unrest in the Balkans and how nationalist sentiments were further fueled, leading to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Including these details would strengthen your argument significantly and demonstrate your knowledge.\n",
    "3. **Develop Your Reasoning and Structure**: You have a coherent line of reasoning, but it could be more sustained and persuasive. Instead of stating, \"I agree to some extent,\" you could clarify whether you believe the alliance system was the primary cause or if other factors were equally important. For example, you might say, \"While the alliance system contributed significantly to the outbreak of WWI by creating divided camps, factors such as nationalism and imperialism also played crucial roles.\" This type of reasoning will help you form a more complex judgment.\n",
    "4. **Expand Your Conclusion**: Your conclusion is brief and doesn't add much depth to your argument. Instead of simply restating your opinion, summarize your main points more comprehensively and reinforce why the alliance system was significant in your analysis. You might say, \"In conclusion, although the alliance system was a crucial factor leading to WWI by entangling nations in mutual defense obligations, it's important to recognize that other elements such as rising nationalism, imperial competition, and militarism also significantly contributed to the war's outbreak.\" This gives the reader a clearer sense of your overall argument.\n",
    "5. **Use Clear Examples to Illustrate Points**: When discussing the Schlieffen Plan, consider elaborating on why it failed and its impact. You mentioned that \"the failure of the Schlieffen Plan\" occurred, but you could specify how this plan intended to quickly knock out France to avoid fighting a two-front war, leading to Germany’s inability to mobilize effectively and further entrenching Britain and France as allies against them.\n",
    "By implementing these strategies, you'll enhance your answer by demonstrating a more complex understanding of the various causes of World War I, which is crucial for reaching the higher levels of the mark scheme. Keep up the hard work!\n",

      "You've made a solid effort in evaluating Sources B and C for their usefulness in understanding military technology and tactics during the First World War. It’s clear that you recognize the importance of both sources and their contributions. Here are specific suggestions to help you improve your response and aim for higher marks:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Deepen the Evaluation of Source B**: \n",
      "   - You mentioned that Source B shows how the British army planned to use the 'creeping barrage'. To enhance this point, you could explain more about how this tactic was intended to work and its significance in changing military strategy. Rather than just stating that it \"was supposed to work,\" it would be beneficial to clarify how “the creeping barrage aimed to provide artillery cover as troops advanced, which was intended to protect them from enemy fire while successfully capturing enemy trenches.” This level of detail showcases a more developed understanding of the content.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Analyze the Context of Source B**: \n",
      "   - You noted that the initial attempts at the 'creeping barrage' led to many friendly fire incidents. Expanding on this can strengthen your evaluation. For example, you could say, “This demonstrates the challenges faced by military planners in the trenches, highlighting the difficulties of coordination and communication during warfare, which contributed to the overall losses.” Including an analysis of how warfare evolved and the impact of such mistakes provides deeper insight into the use of technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Expand on the Provenance of Source B**: \n",
      "   - Discussing the provenance—which refers to the origin and context of the source—adds depth to your evaluation. You could mention the source's date and author if that information is available. For example, “If Source B was produced later in the war, it likely reflects an evolved understanding of warfare, which can inform historians about how tactics shifted in response to the stalemate on the Western Front.” This helps to illustrate why the source is valuable for historians.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Enhance the Analysis of Source C**: \n",
      "   - While you accurately identify Source C as a first-hand account, try to provide more analysis of its content. For example, instead of just stating it gives an idea of how soldiers felt, you might say, \"Source C captures the emotional and psychological impact of tank warfare on soldiers, revealing both the fear and reliance on newly developed tank technology during critical battles.\" This adds depth to your evaluation of its usefulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Consider the Impact of the Author’s Background in Source C**: \n",
      "   - You correctly identify the author as a soldier who received a bravery medal. You could deepen your evaluation by stating how this background lends credibility to the source. For instance, “The author’s firsthand experience and recognition for bravery not only validate the account but also provide insight into the morale and experiences of soldiers, showing how they adapted to the technological advancements represented by the 'Whippet' tanks.”\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Fine-Tune Your Conclusion**: \n",
      "   - Conclude by summarizing the overall usefulness of the sources more explicitly. A comprehensive concluding statement could be: “In conclusion, both Source B and Source C are valuable for historians studying military technology and tactics, as they offer insights into the evolution of strategies employed by the British army and the lived experiences of soldiers on the battlefield.”\n",
      "\n",
      "By implementing these suggestions, you will create a more thorough evaluation of Sources B and C, effectively linking content and provenance to their utility in understanding military technology and tactics during the First World War. This deeper analysis will position your answer higher within the mark scheme. Keep up the good work!\n"

For Source B, the student identifies the use of the artillery barrage and explains its significance in military tactics, mentioning the concept of the 'creeping barrage'. They also touch on the historical context by noting that the initial use of this tactic resulted in friendly fire incidents. However, the evaluation of the source's utility is not fully developed, and there is no mention of the provenance of the source, which is necessary for higher-level responses.\n",

      "For Source C, the student recognizes the value of a first-hand account from a tank commander and mentions the credibility of the source due to the author's direct experience and bravery award. They also highlight the introduction of the 'Whippet' tanks and their impact on the battlefield. However, the analysis lacks depth, and there is no detailed evaluation of the content or provenance.\n",
