    "The student provides a basic explanation of the alliance system and its role in the causes of WW1. They mention the involvement of Austria-Hungary, Serbia, Russia, and Germany, as well as the failure of the Schlieffen Plan and the involvement of Britain and Belgium. However, the explanation lacks depth and detailed factual knowledge. The student does not fully develop their reasoning or provide a sustained line of argument.\\n\\nThe answer demonstrates basic knowledge and understanding of the alliance system and its impact on the outbreak of WW1. The line of reasoning is coherent but not well-developed or substantiated. The conclusion is brief and does not add much to the overall argument.\\n\\nTo reach a higher level, the student would need to provide a more detailed and developed explanation of the alliance system and other factors that contributed to the outbreak of WW1.

    "Student Feedback:\n",
    "You've made a good start by acknowledging the role of the alliance system, and it's clear that you have some understanding of how different nations were involved. Here are specific ways you can improve your response to achieve higher marks:\n",
    "1. **Deepen Your Explanation of the Alliance System**: You mentioned that the alliance system was a factor in the causes of WWI, but it's important to elaborate on how it functioned. For instance, you could explain that the alliance system created a network of treaties that turned a local conflict into a larger war. Try mentioning how the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy) and the Triple Entente (Britain, France, and Russia) were designed to provide mutual defense and how this heightened tensions. This added detail shows a deeper understanding of the alliances' implications.\n",
    "2. **Provide More Detailed Factual Knowledge**: While you discuss the involvement of Austria-Hungary, Serbia, and Russia, try to enhance your argument with specific details. For example, you noted that Russia supported Serbia after Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia. You could mention how this annexation caused unrest in the Balkans and how nationalist sentiments were further fueled, leading to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Including these details would strengthen your argument significantly and demonstrate your knowledge.\n",
    "3. **Develop Your Reasoning and Structure**: You have a coherent line of reasoning, but it could be more sustained and persuasive. Instead of stating, \"I agree to some extent,\" you could clarify whether you believe the alliance system was the primary cause or if other factors were equally important. For example, you might say, \"While the alliance system contributed significantly to the outbreak of WWI by creating divided camps, factors such as nationalism and imperialism also played crucial roles.\" This type of reasoning will help you form a more complex judgment.\n",
    "4. **Expand Your Conclusion**: Your conclusion is brief and doesn't add much depth to your argument. Instead of simply restating your opinion, summarize your main points more comprehensively and reinforce why the alliance system was significant in your analysis. You might say, \"In conclusion, although the alliance system was a crucial factor leading to WWI by entangling nations in mutual defense obligations, it's important to recognize that other elements such as rising nationalism, imperial competition, and militarism also significantly contributed to the war's outbreak.\" This gives the reader a clearer sense of your overall argument.\n",
    "5. **Use Clear Examples to Illustrate Points**: When discussing the Schlieffen Plan, consider elaborating on why it failed and its impact. You mentioned that \"the failure of the Schlieffen Plan\" occurred, but you could specify how this plan intended to quickly knock out France to avoid fighting a two-front war, leading to Germany’s inability to mobilize effectively and further entrenching Britain and France as allies against them.\n",
    "By implementing these strategies, you'll enhance your answer by demonstrating a more complex understanding of the various causes of World War I, which is crucial for reaching the higher levels of the mark scheme. Keep up the hard work!\n",

    "You've made a good start by acknowledging the role of the alliance system, and it's clear that you have some understanding of how different nations were involved. Here are specific ways you can improve your response to achieve higher marks:\n",
    "1. **Deepen Your Explanation of the Alliance System**: You mentioned that the alliance system was a factor in the causes of WWI, but it's important to elaborate on how it functioned. For instance, you could explain that the alliance system created a network of treaties that turned a local conflict into a larger war. Try mentioning how the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy) and the Triple Entente (Britain, France, and Russia) were designed to provide mutual defense and how this heightened tensions. This added detail shows a deeper understanding of the alliances' implications.\n",
    "2. **Provide More Detailed Factual Knowledge**: While you discuss the involvement of Austria-Hungary, Serbia, and Russia, try to enhance your argument with specific details. For example, you noted that Russia supported Serbia after Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia. You could mention how this annexation caused unrest in the Balkans and how nationalist sentiments were further fueled, leading to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Including these details would strengthen your argument significantly and demonstrate your knowledge.\n",
    "3. **Develop Your Reasoning and Structure**: You have a coherent line of reasoning, but it could be more sustained and persuasive. Instead of stating, \"I agree to some extent,\" you could clarify whether you believe the alliance system was the primary cause or if other factors were equally important. For example, you might say, \"While the alliance system contributed significantly to the outbreak of WWI by creating divided camps, factors such as nationalism and imperialism also played crucial roles.\" This type of reasoning will help you form a more complex judgment.\n",
    "4. **Expand Your Conclusion**: Your conclusion is brief and doesn't add much depth to your argument. Instead of simply restating your opinion, summarize your main points more comprehensively and reinforce why the alliance system was significant in your analysis. You might say, \"In conclusion, although the alliance system was a crucial factor leading to WWI by entangling nations in mutual defense obligations, it's important to recognize that other elements such as rising nationalism, imperial competition, and militarism also significantly contributed to the war's outbreak.\" This gives the reader a clearer sense of your overall argument.\n",
    "5. **Use Clear Examples to Illustrate Points**: When discussing the Schlieffen Plan, consider elaborating on why it failed and its impact. You mentioned that \"the failure of the Schlieffen Plan\" occurred, but you could specify how this plan intended to quickly knock out France to avoid fighting a two-front war, leading to Germany’s inability to mobilize effectively and further entrenching Britain and France as allies against them.\n",
    "By implementing these strategies, you'll enhance your answer by demonstrating a more complex understanding of the various causes of World War I, which is crucial for reaching the higher levels of the mark scheme. Keep up the hard work!\n",
